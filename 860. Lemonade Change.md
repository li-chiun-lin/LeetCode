# Easy

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $\$5$. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $\$5$, $\$10$, or $\$20$ bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $\$5$.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array $bills$ where $bills[i]$ is the bill the $i$-th customer pays, return $true$ if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool lemonadeChange(vector<int>& bills) {
        vector<int> change(21);
        vector<int> b = {20, 10, 5};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < bills.size(); ++i)
        {
            ++ change[bills[i]];
            
            int diff = bills[i] - 5;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < b.size() && diff; ++j)
            {
                int idx = b[j];
                
                while (diff >= idx && change[idx])
                {
                    -- change[idx];
                    diff -= idx;
                }
            }
            
            if (diff)
                return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
