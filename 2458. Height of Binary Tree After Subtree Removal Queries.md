# Hard

You are given the $root$ of a binary tree with $n$ nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from $1$ to $n$. You are also given an array $queries$ of size $m$.

You have to perform $m$ independent queries on the tree where in the $i$-th query you do the following:

- Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value $queries[i]$ from the tree. It is guaranteed that $queries[i]$ will not be equal to the value of the root.

Return an array $answer$ of size $m$ where $answer[i]$ is the height of the tree after performing the $i$-th query.

Note:

- The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
- The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int l, map<int, pair<int, int>>& lvl, map<int, pair<int, int>>& dep)
    {
        if (! node)
            return 0;
        
        int d = 1 + max(dfs(node->left, l + 1, lvl, dep), 
                        dfs(node->right, l + 1, lvl, dep));
        lvl[node->val] = {l, d};
        
        if (dep[l].first < d)
        {
            dep[l].second = dep[l].first;
            dep[l].first = d;
        }
        else if (dep[l].second < d)
        {
            dep[l].second = d;
        }
        
        return d;
    }
    
public:
    vector<int> treeQueries(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& queries) {
        map<int, pair<int, int>> lvl;
        map<int, pair<int, int>> dep;
        
        dfs(root, 0, lvl, dep);
        
        vector<int> ret;
        
        for (auto q : queries)
        {
            int l = lvl[q].first;
            int d = dep[l].first == lvl[q].second ? dep[l].second : dep[l].first;
            ret.push_back(l + d - 1);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
