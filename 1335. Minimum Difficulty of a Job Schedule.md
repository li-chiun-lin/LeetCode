# Hard

You want to schedule a list of jobs in $d$ days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the $i$-th job, you have to finish all the jobs $j$ where $0 \leq j < i$).

You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the $d$ days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

You are given an integer array $jobDifficulty$ and an integer $d$. The difficulty of the $i$-th job is $jobDifficulty[i]$.

Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDifficulty(vector<int>& jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.size();
        int inf = 1e9 + 7;
        
        if (n < d)
            return -1;
            
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, inf);
        dp[n] = 0;
        
        for (int x = 1; x <= d; ++x)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - x; ++i)
            {
                int m = 0;
                dp[i] = inf;
                
                for (int j = i; j <= n - x; ++j)
                {
                    m = max(m, jobDifficulty[j]);
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], m + dp[j + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```
