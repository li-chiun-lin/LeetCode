# Easy

You are given an integer $n$.

Each number from $1$ to $n$ is grouped according to the sum of its digits.

Return the number of groups that have the largest size.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countLargestGroup(int n) {
        map<int, vector<int>> hist;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        {
            int x = i;
            int d = 0;
            
            while (x)
            {
                d += x % 10;
                x /= 10;
            }
            
            hist[d].push_back(i);
        }
        
        map<int, int> ss;
        
        for (auto &h : hist)
            ++ss[h.second.size()];
        
        int m = 0;
        
        for (auto &s : ss)
            m = max(m, s.first);
        
        return ss[m];
    }
};
```
