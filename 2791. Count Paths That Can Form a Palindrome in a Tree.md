# Hard

You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at node $0$ consisting of $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array $parent$ of size $n$, where $parent[i]$ is the parent of node $i$. Since node $0$ is the root, $parent[0] == -1$.

You are also given a string $s$ of length $n$, where $s[i]$ is the character assigned to the edge between $i$ and $parent[i]$. $s[0]$ can be ignored.

Return the number of pairs of nodes $(u, v)$ such that $u < v$ and the characters assigned to edges on the path from $u$ to $v$ can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

```cpp
class Solution {
    long long dfs(int u, int mask, string& s, vector<vector<int>>& adj, unordered_map<int, int>& mp)
    {
        long long ret = 0;

        if (u)
        {
            mask ^= 1 << (s[u] - 'a');

            for (int i = 1 << 25; i; i >>= 1)
                ret += mp[mask ^ i];

            ret += mp[mask] ++;
        }

        for (int v : adj[u])
            ret += dfs(v, mask, s, adj, mp);

        return ret;
    }

public:
    long long countPalindromePaths(vector<int>& parent, string s) {
        int n = size(s);
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            adj[parent[i]].push_back(i);

        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        mp[0] = 1;

        return dfs(0, 0, s, adj, mp);
    }
};
