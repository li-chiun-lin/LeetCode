# Medium

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones $piles[i]$.  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.  Initially, $M = 1$.

On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first $X$ remaining piles, where $1 <= X <= 2M$.  Then, we set $M = \max(M, X)$.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(vector<int>& p, int i, int m, vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        if (i + 2 * m >= p.size())
            return p[i];

        if (dp[i][m])
            return dp[i][m];

        int ret = 0;

        for (int x = 1; x <= 2 * m; ++x)
            ret = max(ret, p[i] - dfs(p, i + x, max(x, m), dp));

        return dp[i][m] = ret;
    }
    
public:
    int stoneGameII(vector<int>& piles) {
        int n = piles.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n));

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)
            piles[i] += piles[i + 1];

        return dfs(piles, 0, 1, dp);
    }
};
```
