You are given an integer array $nums$ and an integer $k$. You may partition $nums$ into one or more subsequences such that each element in $nums$ appears in exactly one of the subsequences.

Return the minimum number of subsequences needed such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each subsequence is at most $k$.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int partitionArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Sort the array so that close elements are grouped together
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // Initialize partition count and the lower bound (start of current group)
        int partitionCount = 0;
        int groupStart = nums[0];

        // Traverse the array to form groups
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            // If the current number exceeds the allowed difference k
            // Start a new group from this number
            if (nums[i] - groupStart > k) {
                ++partitionCount;
                groupStart = nums[i]; // Reset group start
            }
        }

        // Final count is number of partitions + 1 (for the last group)
        return partitionCount + 1;
    }
};
```
