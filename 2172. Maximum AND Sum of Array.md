# Hard

You are given an integer array $nums$ of length $n$ and an integer $numSlots$ such that $2 \times numSlots \geq n$. There are $numSlots$ slots numbered from $1$ to $numSlots$.

You have to place all $n$ integers into the slots such that each slot contains at most two numbers. The AND sum of a given placement is the sum of the bitwise AND of every number with its respective slot number.

Return the maximum possible AND sum of $nums$ given $numSlots$ slots.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumANDSum(vector<int>& nums, int numSlots) {
        int n = numSlots * 2;
        nums.resize(n);
        int ub = 1 << n;
        vector<int> dp(ub);

        for (int mask = 1; mask < ub; ++mask)
        {
            int cnt = __builtin_popcount(mask);
            int slot = (cnt + 1) / 2;

            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
                if (mask >> i & 1)
                    dp[mask] = max(dp[mask], dp[mask ^ (1 << i)] + (slot & nums[i]));
        }

        return dp.back();
    }
};
```
