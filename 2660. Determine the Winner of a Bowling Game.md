# Easy

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays $player1$ and $player2$, that represent the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game, respectively.

The bowling game consists of $n$ turns, and the number of pins in each turn is exactly $10$.

Assume a player hit $x_i$ pins in the $i$-th turn. The value of the $i$-th turn for the player is:

- $2 \times x_i$ if the player hit $10$ pins in any of the previous two turns.
- Otherwise, It is $x_i$.

The score of the player is the sum of the values of their $n$ turns.

Return

- $1$ if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,
- $2$ if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and
- $0$ in case of a draw.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int isWinner(vector<int>& player1, vector<int>& player2) {
        int n = player1.size();
        int s1 = 0;
        int s2 = 0;
        int double1 = 0;
        int double2 = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            s1 += player1[i];
            s2 += player2[i];
            
            if (double1)
            {
                s1 += player1[i];
                -- double1;
            }
            
            if (double2)
            {
                s2 += player2[i];
                -- double2;
            }
            
            if (player1[i] == 10)
                double1 = 2;
            
            if (player2[i] == 10)
                double2 = 2;
        }
        
        return s1 > s2 ? 1 : (s1 < s2 ? 2 : 0);
    }
};
