You are given a 0-indexed 2D array $grid$ of size $2 \times n$, where $grid[r][c]$ represents the number of points at position $(r, c)$ on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.

Both robots initially start at $(0, 0)$ and want to reach $(1, n-1)$. Each robot may only move to the right ($(r, c)$ to $(r, c + 1)$) or down ($(r, c)$ to $(r + 1, c)$).

At the start of the game, the first robot moves from $(0, 0)$ to $(1, n-1)$, collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells $(r, c)$ traversed on the path, $grid[r][c]$ is set to $0$. Then, the second robot moves from $(0, 0)$ to $(1, n-1)$, collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.

The first robot wants to minimize the number of points collected by the second robot. In contrast, the second robot wants to maximize the number of points it collects. If both robots play optimally, return the number of points collected by the second robot.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    long long gridGame(vector<vector<int>>& grid) 
    {
        int n = grid[0].size(); // Number of columns in the grid
        long long upperSum = accumulate(grid[0].begin(), grid[0].end(), 0LL); // Total sum of the first row
        long long lowerSum = 0; // Sum of elements collected in the second row
        long long minSecondRobotScore = LLONG_MAX; // Minimum score of the second robot

        // Iterate through each column
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) 
        {
            // Decrease the current cell value from the upper row sum
            upperSum -= grid[0][i];

            // Calculate the maximum score the second robot can achieve
            long long secondRobotScore = max(upperSum, lowerSum);

            // Update the minimum possible score of the second robot
            minSecondRobotScore = min(minSecondRobotScore, secondRobotScore);

            // Add the current cell value to the lower row sum
            lowerSum += grid[1][i];
        }

        return minSecondRobotScore; // Return the minimum score of the second robot
    }
};
```
