You are given an undirected connected graph with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$ and a 2D integer array $edges$ where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]$ denotes an undirected edge between node $u_i$ and node $v_i$ with weight $w_i$, and an integer $k$.

You are allowed to remove any number of edges from the graph such that the resulting graph has at most $k$ connected components.

The cost of a component is defined as the maximum edge weight in that component. If a component has no edges, its cost is 0.

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum cost among all components after such removals.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int k) {
        if (n <= k)
            return 0;
        
        // Sort edges by their weight in ascending order
        sort(begin(edges), end(edges), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[2] < b[2];
        });

        // Initialize Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure
        vector<int> parent(n);
        iota(begin(parent), end(parent), 0);  // Each node is its own parent initially

        // Count of connected components (initially n)
        int components = n;

        // Find function with path compression
        function<int(int)> find = [&](int x) -> int {
            if (parent[x] != x)
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            return parent[x];
        };

        // Union function, returns true if union was successful (different sets)
        auto unite = [&](int x, int y) -> bool {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        };

        // Iterate over edges by ascending weight
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            int w = edge[2];

            // If union merges two different components, decrement component count
            if (unite(u, v))
                --components;

            // Once number of connected components is <= k, return the current edge weight
            if (components <= k) {
                return w;
            }
        }

        // If already have <= k components (or no edges), minimum cost is 0
        return 0;
    }
};
