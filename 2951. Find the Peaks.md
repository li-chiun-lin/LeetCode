# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed array $mountain$. Your task is to find all the peaks in the $mountain$ array.

Return an array that consists of indices of peaks in the given array in any order.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findPeaks(vector<int>& mountain) {
        vector<int> ans;
        int n = size(mountain);
        
        for (int i = 1; i + 1 < n; ++i)
            if (mountain[i - 1] < mountain[i] && mountain[i] > mountain[i + 1])
                ans.push_back(i);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
