You are standing at position $0$ on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position $target$.

You can make some number of moves $numMoves$ so that:

- On each move, you can either go left or right.
- During the $i$-th move (starting from $i == 1$ to $i == numMoves$), you take $i$ steps in the chosen direction.

Given the integer $target$, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum $numMoves$) to reach the destination.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reachNumber(int target) {
        target = abs(target);
        int step = 0;
        int sum = 0;

        while (sum < target || (sum - target) % 2)
            sum += ++ step;

        return step;
    }
};
```
