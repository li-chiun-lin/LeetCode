# Easy

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        
        while (n)
        {
            cnt += n & 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        
        while (n)
        {
            n &= n - 1;
            ++ cnt;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
