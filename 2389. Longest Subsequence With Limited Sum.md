# Easy

You are given an integer array $nums$ of length $n$, and an integer array $queries$ of length $m$.

Return an array $answer$ of length $m$ where $answer[i]$ is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from $nums$ such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to $queries[i]$.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> answerQueries(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& queries) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ret;
        
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));
        
        for (int q : queries)
        {
            int i = 0;
            while (q >= 0 && i < n)
                q -= nums[i ++];
            
            if (q < 0)
                -- i;
                
            ret.push_back(i);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
