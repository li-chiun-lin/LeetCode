We have two arrays $arr1$ and $arr2$ which are initially empty. You need to add positive integers to them such that they satisfy all the following conditions:

- $arr1$ contains $uniqueCnt1$ distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by $divisor1$.
- $arr2$ contains $uniqueCnt2$ distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by $divisor2$.
- No integer is present in both $arr1$ and $arr2$.

Given $divisor1, divisor2, uniqueCnt1,$ and $uniqueCnt2$, return the minimum possible maximum integer that can be present in either array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimizeSet(int divisor1, int divisor2, int uniqueCnt1, int uniqueCnt2) {
        auto check = [&](long long x)
        {
            long long a1 = x / divisor1;
            long long a2 = x - a1;
            long long b1 = x / divisor2;
            long long b2 = x - b1;
            long long a1_inter_b1 = x / lcm((long long)divisor1, (long long)divisor2);
            long long a1_union_b1 = a1 + b1 - a1_inter_b1;
            long long a2_inter_b2 = x - a1_union_b1;
            long long a3 = max(0LL, uniqueCnt1 - (a2 - a2_inter_b2));
            long long b3 = max(0LL, uniqueCnt2 - (b2 - a2_inter_b2));

            return a2_inter_b2 >= (a3 + b3);
        };

        long long l = 1;
        long long r = 1e17;

        while (l + 1 < r)
        {
            long long m = l + (r - l) / 2;

            if (check(m))
                r = m;
            else
                l = m;
        }

        return r;
    }
};
```
