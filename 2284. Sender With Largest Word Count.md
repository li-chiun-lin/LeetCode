You have a chat log of $n$ messages. You are given two string arrays $messages$ and $senders$ where $messages[i]$ is a message sent by $senders[i]$.

A message is list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. The word count of a sender is the total number of words sent by the sender. Note that a sender may send more than one message.

Return the sender with the largest word count. If there is more than one sender with the largest word count, return the one with the lexicographically largest name.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string largestWordCount(vector<string>& messages, vector<string>& senders) {
        map<string, int> cnt;
        int n = messages.size();
        
        // count words by spaces.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            cnt[senders[i]] += count(begin(messages[i]), end(messages[i]), ' ') + 1;
        
        int m = 0;
        string who = "";
        
        // find the largest word count
        for (auto &h : cnt)
        {
            if (m < h.second || (m == h.second && who < h.first))
            {
                m = h.second;
                who = h.first;
            }
        }
        
        return who;
    }
};
```
