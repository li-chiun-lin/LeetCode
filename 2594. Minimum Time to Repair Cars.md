# Medium

You are given an integer array $ranks$ representing the ranks of some mechanics. $ranks_i$ is the rank of the $i$-th mechanic. A mechanic with a rank $r$ can repair $n$ cars in $r \times n^2$ minutes.

You are also given an integer $cars$ representing the total number of cars waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return the minimum time taken to repair all the cars.

Note: All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long repairCars(vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
        long long left = 1, right = 1e14;  // Define binary search range for minimum time

        while (left < right) {
            long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  // Avoids potential overflow
            long long totalCarsRepaired = 0;

            // Calculate total number of cars that can be repaired within 'mid' time
            for (int rank : ranks) {
                totalCarsRepaired += sqrt(mid / rank);  // Each mechanic can repair sqrt(mid / rank) cars
            }

            // Adjust search range based on whether enough cars can be repaired
            if (totalCarsRepaired < cars)
                left = mid + 1;  // Need more time
            else
                right = mid;  // Try a smaller time

        }
        
        return left;  // Minimum time needed to repair all cars
    }
};
```
