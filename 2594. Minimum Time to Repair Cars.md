# Medium

You are given an integer array $ranks$ representing the ranks of some mechanics. $ranks_i$ is the rank of the $i$-th mechanic. A mechanic with a rank $r$ can repair $n$ cars in $r * n^2$ minutes.

You are also given an integer $cars$ representing the total number of cars waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return the minimum time taken to repair all the cars.

Note: All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long repairCars(vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
        long long l = 1, r = 1e14;

        while (l < r)
        {
            auto m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            long long cnt = 0;

            for (auto r : ranks)
                cnt += sqrt(m / r);

            if (cnt < cars)
                l = m + 1;
            else
                r = m;
        }
        
        return l;
    }
};
```
