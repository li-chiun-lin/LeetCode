# Easy

You are given a positive integer $n$ representing an $n \times n$ cargo deck on a ship. Each cell on the deck can hold one container with a weight of exactly $w$.

However, the total weight of all containers, if loaded onto the deck, must not exceed the ship's maximum weight capacity, $maxWeight$.

Return the maximum number of containers that can be loaded onto the ship.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxContainers(int n, int w, int maxWeight) {
        return min(n * n, maxWeight / w);
    }
};
```
