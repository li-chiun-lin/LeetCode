# Hard

You are given an array $points$ of size $n$ and an integer $m$. There is another array $gameScore$ of size $n$, where $gameScore[i]$ represents the score achieved at the $i$-th game. Initially, $gameScore[i] == 0$ for all $i$.

You start at index $-1$, which is outside the array (before the first position at index 0). You can make at most $m$ moves. In each move, you can either:

- Increase the index by $1$ and add $points[i]$ to $gameScore[i]$.
- Decrease the index by $1$ and add $points[i]$ to $gameScore[i]$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Function to check if we can achieve a score `val` within `m` operations
    bool canAchieve(const vector<int>& points, int m, long long val) {
        int n = points.size();  // Number of points
        long long total = 0;  // Keeps track of the total operations used
        long long transfer = 0;  // Keeps track of operations we can carry over to the next iteration
        long long skipAdd = 0;  // Keeps track of skipped additions (for extra ops already done)

        for (int i = 0; i < n && total <= m; i++) {
            int point = points[i];  // The current point value in the list
            long long necessary = (val + point - 1) / point;  // Minimum operations needed to achieve `val` using this point
            
            // If we can use the carry-over transfer to satisfy the current need
            if (transfer >= necessary) {
                transfer = 0;  // No need for more carry-over after using it
                skipAdd++;  // We skip the addition since we used carried over operations
            } else {
                // Calculate how many operations are required to achieve `val` after using the carry-over transfer
                long long p = transfer * point;  // The value contributed by the carried-over operations
                long long ops = ((val - p) + point - 1) / point;  // Operations needed to reach the remaining value
                
                total += 2 * ops - 1;  // Add the operations, accounting for the carry-over mechanism
                total += skipAdd;  // Include any skipped additions from previous iterations
                
                transfer = max(ops - 1, 0LL);  // Carry-over any leftover operations for the next iteration
                skipAdd = 0;  // Reset the skip counter as we've used it
            }
        }
        return total <= m;  // If the total operations used is less than or equal to `m`, return true
    }
    
public:
    long long maxScore(vector<int>& points, int m) {
        int n = points.size();  // Get the number of elements in the points vector
        if (m < n) return 0;  // If m is less than n, it's impossible to achieve a score, so return 0

        // Binary search for the maximum achievable score
        long long left = 1, right = 1e18, ans = 0;  // Define the binary search range
        while (left <= right) {
            long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  // Middle value of the current range
            
            // Check if it's possible to achieve the score `mid` within `m` operations
            if (canAchieve(points, m, mid)) {
                ans = mid;  // Store the best valid score found so far
                left = mid + 1;  // Try for a larger value
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;  // Reduce the search space
            }
        }

        return ans;  // Return the maximum score found
    }
};
