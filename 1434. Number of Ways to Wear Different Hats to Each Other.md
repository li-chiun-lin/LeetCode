# Hard

There are $n$ people and $40$ types of hats labeled from $1$ to $40$.

Given a 2D integer array $hats$, where $hats[i]$ is a list of all hats preferred by the $i$-th person.

Return the number of ways that the $n$ people wear different hats to each other.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberWays(vector<vector<int>>& hats) {
        vector<vector<int>> can_be_assigned_to(41);
        int n = size(hats);
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        // the number of ways of assignment
        // when considering only some of the `n' people.
        vector<int> dp(1 << n);

        // there is only 1 way when considering 0 people.
        dp[0] = 1;

        // hat `h' can be assigned to people `p'
        for (int p = 0; p < n; ++p)
            for (auto h : hats[p])
                can_be_assigned_to[h].push_back(p);

        // for each hat `h', 
        for (int h = 1; h <= 40; ++h)
            // for each possible `way' of assignment, 
            for (int way = size(dp) - 1; way >= 0; --way)
                // for each people `p' that hat 'h' can be assigned to, 
                for (auto p : can_be_assigned_to[h])
                    // if the current `way' hasn't considered this people `p', 
                    if ((way & (1 << p)) == 0)
                        dp[way | (1 << p)] = (dp[way | (1 << p)] + dp[way]) % m;
        
        return dp.back();
    }
};
