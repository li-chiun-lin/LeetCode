# Easy

You are given a positive integer $n$, you can do the following operation any number of times:

- Add or subtract a power of $2$ from $n$.

Return the minimum number of operations to make $n$ equal to $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(int n) {
        int cnt = 0;

        // we first consider all the bits except the most significant bit.
        while (n > 1)
        {
            if (n & 1)
            {
                // if it is a part of a consecutive 1's, 
                // we add one to create a `carry' toward higher bits.
                if (n & 2)
                    ++ n;
                // and when it is a single/lonely bit, 
                // we substract it.
                else
                    -- n;

                // in both cases, we perform one operation.
                ++ cnt;
            }
            else
                n >>= 1;
        }

        // we might need to perform one more additional substract operation 
        // to annihilate the leading bit.
        return cnt + n;
    }
};
```
