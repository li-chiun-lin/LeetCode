# Medium

You are given two images, $img1$ and $img2$, represented as binary, square matrices of size $n \times n$. A binary matrix has only $0$'s and $1$'s as values.

We translate one image however we choose by sliding all the $1$ bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units. We then place it on top of the other image. We can then calculate the overlap by counting the number of positions that have a $1$ in both images.

Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation. Any $1$ bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.

Return the largest possible overlap.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestOverlap(vector<vector<int>>& img1, vector<vector<int>>& img2) {
        int n = img1.size();
        int n3 = n * 3;
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i + n < n3; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j + n < n3; ++j)
            {
                int sum = 0;
                
                for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r)
                    for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c)
                        if (0 <= n - i + r && n - i + r < n && 
                            0 <= n - j + c && n - j + c < n &&
                            img1[n - i + r][n - j + c] && img2[r][c])
                            ++ sum;
                
                cnt = max(cnt, sum);
            }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
