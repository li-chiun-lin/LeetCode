You have $n$ processors each having $4$ cores and $n \times 4$ tasks that need to be executed such that each core should perform only one task.

Given a 0-indexed integer array $processorTime$ representing the time at which each processor becomes available for the first time and a 0-indexed integer array $tasks$ representing the time it takes to execute each task, return the minimum time when all of the tasks have been executed by the processors.

Note: Each core executes the task independently of the others.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minProcessingTime(vector<int>& processorTime, vector<int>& tasks) {
        sort(begin(processorTime), end(processorTime));
        sort(begin(tasks), end(tasks), greater<>());
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < size(processorTime); ++i)
            for (int c = 0; c < 4; ++c, ++j)
                ans = max(ans, processorTime[i] + tasks[j]);

        return ans;
    }
};
```
