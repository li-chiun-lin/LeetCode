Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a circular field surrounded by flowers. The circle represents the field, and there are $x$ flowers in the clockwise direction between Alice and Bob, and $y$ flowers in the anti-clockwise direction between them.

The game proceeds as follows:

- Alice takes the first turn.
- In each turn, a player must choose either the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and pick one flower from that side.
- At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all, the current player captures their opponent and wins the game.

Given two integers, $n$ and $m$, the task is to compute the number of possible pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the conditions:

- Alice must win the game according to the described rules.
- The number of flowers $x$ in the clockwise direction must be in the range $[1,n]$.
- The number of flowers $y$ in the anti-clockwise direction must be in the range $[1,m]$.

Return the number of possible pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the statement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long flowerGame(int n, int m) {
        long long case1 = (((long long)n + 1) / 2) * (m / 2);
        long long case2 = ((long long)n / 2) * ((m + 1) / 2);
        return case1 + case2;
    }
};
```
