Given two integers $a$ and $b$, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators $+$ and $-$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        // it is important to declare it as unsiged.
        unsigned int c = 0;
        
        while (b)
        {
            c = a & b;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = c << 1;
        }
        
        return a;
    }
};
```
