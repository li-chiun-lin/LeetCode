You are given five integers $cost1$, $cost2$, $costBoth$, $need1$, and $need2$.

There are three types of items available:

- An item of type 1 costs $cost1$ and contributes 1 unit to the type 1 requirement only.
- An item of type 2 costs $cost2$ and contributes 1 unit to the type 2 requirement only.
- An item of type 3 costs $costBoth$ and contributes 1 unit to both type 1 and type 2 requirements.

You must collect enough items so that the total contribution toward type 1 is at least $need1$ and the total contribution toward type 2 is at least $need2$.

Return an integer representing the minimum possible total cost to achieve these requirements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumCost(int cost1, int cost2, int costBoth, int need1, int need2) {
        if (cost1 + cost2 >= costBoth)
        {
            long long n = min(need1, need2);
            long long sum = n * costBoth;

            need1 -= n;
            need2 -= n;

            if (need1)
            {
                long long c = min(cost1, costBoth);
                sum += c * need1;
            }
            else if (need2)
            {
                long long c = min(cost2, costBoth);
                sum += c * need2;
            }

            return sum;
        }
        else
        {
            return (long long)need1 * cost1 + (long long)need2 * cost2;
        }
    }
};
```
