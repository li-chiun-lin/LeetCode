We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:

- I pick a number between 1 and n.
- You guess a number.
- If you guess the right number, you win the game.
- If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.
- Every time you guess a wrong number $x$, you will pay $x$ dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.

Given a particular $n$, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(int s, int e, vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        if (s >= e)
            return 0;
        
        if (dp[s][e])
            return dp[s][e];
        
        int r = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int x = s; x <= e; ++x)
        {
            int pay = x + max(dfs(s, x - 1, dp), dfs(x + 1, e, dp));
            r = min(r, pay);
        }
        
        return dp[s][e] = r;
    }
public:
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1));
        
        return dfs(1, n, dp);
    }
};
```
