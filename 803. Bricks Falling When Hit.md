# Hard

You are given an $m \times n$ binary $grid$, where each $1$ represents a brick and $0$ represents an empty space. A brick is stable if:

- It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or
- At least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable.

You are also given an array $hits$, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location $hits[i] = (row_i, col_i)$. The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).

Return an array $result$, where each $result[i]$ is the number of bricks that will fall after the ith erasure is applied.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int d[5] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};

    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& g, int r, int c)
    {
        int cnt = 0;

        if (0 <= r && r < g.size() && 0 <= c && c < g[r].size() && g[r][c] == 1)
        {
            g[r][c] = 2;
            cnt = 1;

            for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k)
                cnt += dfs(g, r + d[k], c + d[k + 1]);
        }

        return cnt;
    }

public:
    vector<int> hitBricks(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& hits) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();

        // applying the erasures.
        for (auto& h : hits)
            -- grid[h[0]][h[1]];

        vector<int> ret(hits.size());

        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            dfs(grid, 0, j);

        // reverse order
        for (int i = hits.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            int r = hits[i][0];
            int c = hits[i][1];

            // it has already been empty.
            if (grid[r][c] == -1)
                continue;

            // put the brick back.
            grid[r][c] = 1;

            // if this is the top row, 
            bool flag = r == 0;

            // or if any of the 4 adjacent cells is connected to top, 
            for (int k = 0; k < 4 && flag == false; ++k)
            {
                int rr = r + d[k];
                int cc = c + d[k + 1];

                if (0 <= rr && rr < m && 0 <= cc && cc < n && grid[rr][cc] == 2)
                    flag = true;
            }

            if (flag)
                ret[i] = dfs(grid, r, c) - 1;
        }

        return ret;
