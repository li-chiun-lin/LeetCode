A generic microwave supports cooking times for:

- at least **1** second.
- at most **99** minutes and **99** seconds.

To set the cooking time, you push **at most four digits**. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by **prepending zeroes**. It interprets the **first** two digits as the minutes and the **last** two digits as the seconds. It then **adds** them up as the cooking time. For example,

- You push **9 5 4** (three digits). It is normalized as **0954** and interpreted as **9** minutes and **54** seconds.
- You push **0 0 0 8** (four digits). It is interpreted as **0** minutes and **8** seconds.
- You push **8 0 9 0**. It is interpreted as **80** minutes and **90** seconds.
- You push **8 1 3 0**. It is interpreted as **81** minutes and **30** seconds.

You are given integers *startAt*, *moveCost*, *pushCost*, and *targetSeconds*. Initially, your finger is on the digit *startAt*. Moving the finger above any specific digit costs *moveCost* units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger once costs *pushCost* units of fatigue.

There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for *targetSeconds* seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.

Return the *minimum cost* to set *targetSeconds* seconds of cooking time.

Remember that one minute consists of **60** seconds.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int cost(int mm, int ss, int idx, int mc, int pc)
    {
        // use this array to represent the 4 digits.
        int mmss[4] = {mm / 10, mm % 10, ss / 10, ss % 10};
        int c = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        // skip leading 0s, if there are any.
        while (i < 4 && mmss[i] == 0)
            ++ i;
        
        // if (i == 4) ;
        // this should never happen according to constraints.
        
        // for the rest digits
        while (i < 4)
        {
            // if the digit differs from the current position of finger, i.e. *idx*, then it must move
            // and thus produces cost.
            if (idx != mmss[i])
            {
                idx = mmss[i];

            // press the button with cost.
            c += pc;
            
            // move to next digit.
            ++ i;
        }

        int ret = INT_MAX;
        int c = 0;
        int ss = targetSeconds;
        
        // Try every possible combination of mm and ss.
        // the mm goes from 00 to 99 and every time when mm increase 1, ss should decrease 60.
        for (int mm = 0; mm < 100 && ss >= 0; ++mm, ss -= 60)
        {
            // if there are more than 99 seconds left, this combination won't work.
            if (ss > 99)
                continue;
            
            // calculate the cost of each combination.
            c = cost(mm, ss, startAt, moveCost, pushCost);
            
            // update the minimal cost.
            ret = min(ret, c);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
