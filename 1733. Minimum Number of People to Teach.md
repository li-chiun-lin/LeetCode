On a social network consisting of **m** users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.

You are given an integer **n**, an array **languages**, and an array **friendships** where:

- There are **n** languages numbered **1** through **n**,
- **languages[i]** is the set of languages the **i**​​​​​​-th​​​​ user knows, and
- $friendships[i] = [u​​​​​​_i​​​, v​​​​​​_i]$ denotes a friendship between the users $u​​​​​​​​​​​_i​​​​​$ and $v_i$.

You can choose one language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return the minimum number of users you need to teach.

Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if **x** is a friend of **y** and **y** is a friend of **z**, this doesn't guarantee that **x** is a friend of **z**.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // check if user u and v share a common language.
    // sorted array and two-pointer
    bool haveCommon(vector<vector<int>>& lan, int u, int v)
    {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        
        while (i < lan[u].size() && j < lan[v].size())
        {
            if (lan[u][i] < lan[v][j])
                ++ i;
            else if (lan[u][i] > lan[v][j])
                ++ j;
            else
                return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }

    int minimumTeachings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& languages, vector<vector<int>>& friendships) {
        int m = languages.size();

                {

        // to fulfill the communication between some of their friendship.
