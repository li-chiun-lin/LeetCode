# Hard

You are given an array $points$, an integer $angle$, and your $location$, where $location = [pos_x, pos_y]$ and $points[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ both denote integral coordinates on the X-Y plane.

Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You cannot move from your position, but you can rotate. In other words, $pos_x$ and $pos_y$ cannot be changed. Your field of view in degrees is represented by $angle$, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let d be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the inclusive range of angles $[d - angle/2, d + angle/2]$.

Your browser does not support the video tag or this video format.

You can see some set of points if, for each point, the angle formed by the point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position is in your field of view.

There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.

Return the maximum number of points you can see.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int visiblePoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, int angle, vector<int>& location) {
        vector<double> theta;
        int ans = 0;
        int overlap = 0;

        for (auto& p : points)
        {
            if (p[0] == location[0] && p[1] == location[1])
                ++ overlap;
            else
                theta.push_back(atan2(p[1] - location[1], p[0] - location[0]) * 180 / M_PI);
        }

        sort(begin(theta), end(theta));
        int n = size(theta);
        int j = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            theta.push_back(theta[i] + 360);

        for (int i = 0; i < size(theta); ++i)
        {
            while (theta[i] - theta[j] > angle)
                ++ j;

            ans = max(ans, i - j + 1);
        }

        return ans + overlap;
    }
};
