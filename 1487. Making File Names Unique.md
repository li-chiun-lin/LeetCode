# Medium

Given an array of strings $names$ of size $n$. You will create $n$ folders in your file system such that, at the $it$-h minute, you will create a folder with the name $names[i]$.

Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name that was previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of ($k$), where, $k$ is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length $n$ where $ans[i]$ is the actual name the system will assign to the $i$-th folder when you create it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> getFolderNames(vector<string>& names) {
        map<string, int> hit;
        int n = names.size();
        vector<string> ret(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int k = hit[names[i]];
            if (k)
            {
                string str = "";
                
                do
                {
                    str = names[i] + "(" + to_string(k ++) + ")";
                } while (hit[str]);
                
                hit[names[i]] = k;
                ++ hit[str];
                ret[i] = str;
            }
            else
            {
                ++ hit[names[i]];
                ret[i] = names[i];
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
