# Hard

You are given an integer array $nums$ of length $n$ where each element is a non-negative integer.

Select two subsequences of $nums$ (they may be empty and are allowed to overlap), each preserving the original order of elements, and let:

- $X$ be the bitwise XOR of all elements in the first subsequence.
- $Y$ be the bitwise XOR of all elements in the second subsequence.

Return the maximum possible value of $X$ XOR $Y$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxXorSubsequences(vector<int>& nums) {
        int x = 0;

        while (true)
        {
            int y = *max_element(begin(nums), end(nums));

            if (y == 0)
                return x;

            x = max(x, x ^ y);

            for (auto& a : nums)
                a = min(a, a ^ y);
        }

        return 0;
    }
};
```
