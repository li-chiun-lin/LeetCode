Given two integers $left$ and $right$ that represent the range $[left, right]$, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        while (right > left)
            right &= right - 1;
        
        return right;
    }
};
```
