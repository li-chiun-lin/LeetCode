# Hard

You are given an integer $power$ and two integer arrays $damage$ and $health$, both having length $n$.

Bob has $n$ enemies, where enemy $i$ will deal Bob $damage[i]$ points of damage per second while they are alive (i.e. $health[i] > 0$).

Every second, after the enemies deal damage to Bob, he chooses one of the enemies that is still alive and deals $power$ points of damage to them.

Determine the minimum total amount of damage points that will be dealt to Bob before all $n$ enemies are dead.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minDamage(int power, vector<int>& damage, vector<int>& health) {
        int n = size(damage);
        long long ans = 0;
        long long total = accumulate(begin(damage), end(damage), 0ll);
        vector<long long> quo(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            quo[i] = (health[i] + power - 1) / power;

        vector<int> idx(n);
        iota(begin(idx), end(idx), 0);
        sort(begin(idx), end(idx), [&](int a, int b)
        {
            return quo[a] * damage[b] < quo[b] * damage[a];
        });

        for (int i : idx)
        {
            ans += total * quo[i];
            total -= damage[i];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
