# Easy

You are given a string $s$. Reorder the string using the following algorithm:

1. Pick the smallest character from $s$ and append it to the result.
1. Pick the smallest character from $s$ which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
1. Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
1. Pick the largest character from $s$ and append it to the result.
1. Pick the largest character from $s$ which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
1. Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
1. Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from $s$.

In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.

Return the result string after sorting $s$ with this algorithm.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string sortString(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> hist(26);
        int idx = 0;
        string ret(n, ' ');
        
        for (char c : s)
            ++ hist[c - 'a'];
        
        while (idx < n)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < hist.size(); ++i)
                if (hist[i])
                {
                    ret[idx ++] = 'a' + i;
                    -- hist[i];
                }
            
            for (int i = hist.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i)
                if (hist[i])
                {
                    ret[idx ++] = 'a' + i;
                    -- hist[i];
                }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
