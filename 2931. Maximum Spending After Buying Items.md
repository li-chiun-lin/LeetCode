# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed $m \times n$ integer matrix $values$, representing the values of $m \times n$ different items in m different shops. Each shop has $n$ items where the $j$-th item in the $i$-th shop has a value of $values[i][j]$. Additionally, the items in the $i$-th shop are sorted in non-increasing order of value.

On each day, you would like to buy a single item from one of the shops. Specifically, On the $d$-th day you can:

- Pick any shop $i$.
- Buy the rightmost available item $j$ for the price of $values[i][j] \times d$. That is, find the greatest index $j$ such that item $j$ was never bought before, and buy it for the price of $values[i][j] \times d$.

Return the maximum amount of money that can be spent on buying all $m \times n$ products.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxSpending(vector<vector<int>>& values) {
        int m = values.size();
        int n = values[0].size();
        priority_queue<
            pair<int, int>, 
            vector<pair<int, int>>, 
            greater<>> pq;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            pq.push({values[i][n - 1], i});
        
        vector<int> idx(m, n - 2);
        
        long long d = 1;
        long long ans = 0;
        
        while (pq.size())
        {
            auto [v, i] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            
            ans += d * v;
            
            if (idx[i] >= 0)
                pq.push({values[i][idx[i] --], i});
            
            ++ d;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
