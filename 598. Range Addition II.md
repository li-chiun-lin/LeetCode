# Easy

You are given an $m \times n$ matrix $M$ initialized with all $0$'s and an array of operations $ops$, where $ops[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ means $M[x] [y]$ should be incremented by one for all $0 \leq x < a_i$ and $0 \leq y < b_i$.

Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCount(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& ops) {
        int h = m;
        int w = n;
        
        for (auto &o : ops)
        {
            h = min(h, o[0]);
            w = min(w, o[1]);
        }
        
        return h * w;
    }
};
```
