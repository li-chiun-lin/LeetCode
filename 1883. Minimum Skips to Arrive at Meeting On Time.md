# Hard

You are given an integer $hoursBefore$, the number of hours you have to travel to your meeting. To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through $n$ roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array $dist$ of length $n$, where $dist[i]$ describes the length of the $i$-th road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer $speed$, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.

After you travel road $i$, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.

However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.

Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or $-1$ if it is impossible.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSkips(vector<int>& dist, int speed, int hoursBefore) {
        int n = size(dist);
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = n; j >= 0; --j)
            {
                dp[j] += dist[i];

                if (i < n - 1)
                    dp[j] = (dp[j] + speed - 1) / speed * speed;

                if (j > 0)
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - 1] + dist[i]);
            }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (dp[i] <= (long long)speed * hoursBefore)
                return i;

        return -1;
    }
};
```
