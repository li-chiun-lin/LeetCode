You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array $nums$ representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        int v0 = 0;
        int v1 = 0;
        
        if (nums.size() == 1)
            return nums[0];
        
        if (nums.size() == 2)
            return max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        
        if (nums.size() == 3)
            return max(max(nums[0], nums[1]), nums[2]);
        
        // take the first
        dp[1] = nums[0];
        
        // don't take the last
        for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i)
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 1], dp[i - 1]);
        
        v0 = dp[n - 1];
        
        // don't take the first;
        dp[1] = 0;
        
        // might take the last
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i)
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 1], dp[i - 1]);
        
        v1 = dp[n];
        
        return max(v0, v1);
    }
};
```
