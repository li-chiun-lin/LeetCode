# Easy

Given a 2D grid of size **m x n** and an integer **k**. You need to shift the **grid** **k** times.

In one shift operation:

- Element at **grid[i][j]** moves to **grid[i][j + 1]**.
- Element at **grid[i][n - 1]** moves to **grid[i + 1][0]**.
- Element at **grid[m - 1][n - 1]** moves to **grid[0][0]**.

Return the 2D **grid** after applying shift operation **k** times.

## My Solution

It consists of two concepts:

1. In-place array shifting/rotating can be decomposed into 3 reverse operations. <br>
    e.x. <br>
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] right rotate 2 => [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] <br>
    equals to <br>
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] reverse => [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] reverse first 2 => [4, 5, 3, 2, 1] reverse rest of the elements => [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
1. The coordinate conversion between 1D and 2D can be achieved by '/' and '%' operators with the width n of the 2D matrix.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverse(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int n, int a, int b)
    {
        int ix, iy, jx, jy;
        
        for (int i = a, j = b; i < j; ++i, --j)
        {
            ix = i / n;
            iy = i % n;
            jx = j / n;
            jy = j % n;
            
            swap(grid[ix][iy], grid[jx][jy]);
        }
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> shiftGrid(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int l = m * n;
        k %= l;
        
        reverse(grid, n, 0, l - 1);
        reverse(grid, n, 0, k - 1);
        reverse(grid, n, k, l - 1);
        
        return grid;
    }
};
```
