# Easy

You are given an array of positive integers $nums$.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. In the game, Alice can choose either all single-digit numbers or all double-digit numbers from $nums$, and the rest of the numbers are given to Bob. Alice wins if the sum of her numbers is strictly greater than the sum of Bob's numbers.

Return $true$ if Alice can win this game, otherwise, return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canAliceWin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int s1 = 0;
        int s2 = 0;
        int s = 0;
        
        for (auto x : nums)
        {
            if (0 <= x && x <= 9)
                s1 += x;
            else if (x <= 99)
                s2 += x;
            
            s += x;
        }
        
        return s1 > s - s1 || s2 > s - s2;
    }
};
```
