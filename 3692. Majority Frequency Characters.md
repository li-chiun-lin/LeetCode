# Easy

You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase English letters.

The frequency group for a value $k$ is the set of characters that appear exactly $k$ times in $s$.

The majority frequency group is the frequency group that contains the largest number of distinct characters.

Return a string containing all characters in the majority frequency group, in any order. If two or more frequency groups tie for that largest size, pick the group whose frequency $k$ is larger.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string majorityFrequencyGroup(string s) {
        // Step 1: Count frequency of each character in the string
        map<char, int> charFrequency;
        for (char c : s) {
            charFrequency[c]++;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Group characters by their frequency counts
        // Key: frequency count, Value: string of all characters with that frequency
        map<int, string> frequencyGroups;
        for (const auto& [character, frequency] : charFrequency) {
            frequencyGroups[frequency].push_back(character);
        }
        
        // Step 3: Find the group with maximum size (majority group)
        int maxGroupSize = 0;           // Size of the largest frequency group found so far
        int maxGroupFrequency = 0;      // Frequency value of the current best group
        string majorityGroup = "";      // Characters in the majority frequency group
        
        for (const auto& [frequency, charactersInGroup] : frequencyGroups) {
            int currentGroupSize = charactersInGroup.size();
            
            // Update majority group if:
            // - Current group is larger, OR
            // - Current group has same size but higher frequency (tie-breaker)
            if (currentGroupSize > maxGroupSize || 
                (currentGroupSize == maxGroupSize && frequency > maxGroupFrequency)) {
                
                maxGroupSize = currentGroupSize;
                maxGroupFrequency = frequency;
                majorityGroup = charactersInGroup;
            }
        }
        
        return majorityGroup;
    }
};
```
