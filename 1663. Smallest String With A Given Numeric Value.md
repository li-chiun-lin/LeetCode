The numeric value of a lowercase character is defined as its position (1-indexed) in the alphabet, so the numeric value of $a$ is $1$, the numeric value of $b$ is $2$, the numeric value of $c$ is $3$, and so on.

The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values.

You are given two integers $n$ and $k$. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to $n$ and numeric value equal to $k$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        // at the very least, a string with length n should consist of a's.
        string ret(n, 'a');
        // substract n from k for that each 'a' in the default return string of length n costs 1.
        k -= n;
        // scan from right to left, we want to keep as many as 'a' at the beginning of the return string.
        int i = n - 1;
        
        while (i >= 0 && k > 0)
        {
            int kk = min(k, 25);
            ret[i --] += kk;
            k -= kk;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
