# Easy

You are given an integer array $ranks$ and a character array $suits$. You have $5$ cards where the $i$th card has a rank of $ranks[i]$ and a suit of $suits[i]$.

The following are the types of poker hands you can make from best to worst:

1. **"Flush"**: Five cards of the same suit.
1. **"Three of a Kind"**: Three cards of the same rank.
1. **"Pair"**: Two cards of the same rank.
1. **"High Card"**: Any single card.

Return a string representing the best type of poker hand you can make with the given cards.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string bestHand(vector<int>& ranks, vector<char>& suits) {
        if (suits[0] == suits[1] 
            && suits[0] == suits[2]  
            && suits[0] == suits[3]  
            && suits[0] == suits[4] )
            return "Flush";
        
        map<int, int> hit;
        
        for (int x : ranks)
            ++hit[x];
        
        for (auto& p : hit)
        {
            if (p.second >= 3)
                return "Three of a Kind";
            else if (p.second == 2)
                return "Pair";
        }
        
        return "High Card";
    }
};
```
