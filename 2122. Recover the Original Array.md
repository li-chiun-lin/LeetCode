# Hard

Alice had a 0-indexed array $arr$ consisting of $n$ positive integers. She chose an arbitrary positive integer $k$ and created two new 0-indexed integer arrays $lower$ and $higher$ in the following manner:

- $lower[i] = arr[i] - k$, for every index $i$ where $0 \leq i < n$
- $higher[i] = arr[i] + k$, for every index $i$ where $0 \leq i < n$

Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays $lower$ and $higher$, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.

Given an array $nums$ consisting of $2n$ integers, where exactly $n$ of the integers were present in $lower$ and the remaining in $higher$, return the original array $arr$. In case the answer is not unique, return any valid array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> recoverArray(vector<int>& nums) { 
        multiset<int> ms(begin(nums), end(nums));
        int lb = *begin(ms);

        for (auto it = next(begin(ms)); it != end(ms); ++it)
        {
            int k = (*it - lb) / 2;

            if (k && lb + k == *it - k)
            {
                vector<int> r;
                auto ss = ms;

                while (size(ss))
                {
                    auto h = ss.find(*begin(ss) + 2 * k);
                    if (h == end(ss))
                        break;

                    r.push_back(*begin(ss) + k);
                    ss.erase(begin(ss));
                    ss.erase(h);
                }

                if (ss.empty())
                    return r;
            }
        }

        return {};
    }
};
```
