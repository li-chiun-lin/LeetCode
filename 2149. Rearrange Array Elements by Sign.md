You are given a 0-indexed integer array **nums** of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should rearrange the elements of **nums** such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

1. Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
1. For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in **nums** is preserved.
1. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> p;
        vector<int> n;
        vector<int> r;
        
        for (int x : nums)
        {
            if (x < 0)
                n.push_back(x);
            else
                p.push_back(x);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < p.size(); ++i)
        {
            r.push_back(p[i]);
            r.push_back(n[i]);
        }
        
        return r;
    }
};
```
