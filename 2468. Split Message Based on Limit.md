# Hard

You are given a string, $message$, and a positive integer, $limit$.

You must split $message$ into one or more parts based on $limit$. Each resulting part should have the suffix "<a/b>", where "b" is to be replaced with the total number of parts and "a" is to be replaced with the index of the part, starting from $1$ and going up to $b$. Additionally, the length of each resulting part (including its suffix) should be equal to $limit$, except for the last part whose length can be at most $limit$.

The resulting parts should be formed such that when their suffixes are removed and they are all concatenated in order, they should be equal to $message$. Also, the result should contain as few parts as possible.

Return the parts $message$ would be split into as an array of strings. If it is impossible to split $message$ as required, return an empty array.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int count(int x)
    {
        int c = 0;

        while (x)
        {
            ++ c;
            x /= 10;
        }

        return c;
    }

public:
    vector<string> splitMessage(string message, int limit) {
        vector<int> cnt(10001);
        vector<int> prefix(10001);

        for (int i = 1; i <= 10000; ++i)
            prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + (cnt[i] = count(i));

        int n = size(message);
        vector<string> ans;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        {
            int nn = n + 3 * i + cnt[i] * i + prefix[i];

            if ((nn + limit - 1) / limit != i)
                continue;

            string s = "";
            int j = 1;
            string sub = "/" + to_string(i) + ">";
            int extra = cnt[i] + 3;

            for (char c : message)
            {
                s.push_back(c);

                if (size(s) + cnt[j] + extra == limit)
                {
                    s += "<" + to_string(j) + sub;
                    ans.push_back(s);
                    s.clear();
                    ++ j;
                }
            }

            if (size(s))
            {
                s += "<" + to_string(j) + sub;
                ans.push_back(s);
            }

            return ans;
        }

        return ans;
    }
