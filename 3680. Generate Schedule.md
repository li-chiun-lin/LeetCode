# Medium

You are given an integer $n$ representing $n$ teams. You are asked to generate a schedule such that:

- Each team plays every other team exactly twice: once at home and once away.
- There is exactly one match per day; the schedule is a list of consecutive days and $schedule[i]$ is the match on day $i$.
- No team plays on consecutive days.

Return a 2D integer array $schedule$, where $schedule[i][0]$ represents the home team and $schedule[i][1]$ represents the away team. If multiple schedules meet the conditions, return any one of them.

If no schedule exists that meets the conditions, return an empty array.
