# Easy

You are given the $root$ of a binary tree where each node has a value $0$ or $1$. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return the sum of these numbers.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rec(TreeNode *root, int acc)
    {
        if (! root)
            return 0;
        
        acc <<= 1;
        acc += root->val;
        
        if (! root->left && ! root->right)
            return acc;
        
        return rec(root->left, acc) + rec(root->right, acc);
    }

    int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        return rec(root, 0);
    }
};
```
