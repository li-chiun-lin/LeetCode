You are building a string $s$ of length $n$ one character at a time, prepending each new character to the front of the string. The strings are labeled from $1$ to $n$, where the string with length $i$ is labeled $s_i$.

The score of $s_i$ is the length of the longest common prefix between $s_i$ and $s_n$.

Given the final string $s$, return the sum of the score of every $s_i$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long sumScores(string s) {
        int n = size(s);
        vector<int> lps(n);

        for (int i = 1, j = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            while (j && s[i] != s[j])
                j = max(0, lps[j - 1]);

            lps[i] = j += s[i] == s[j];
        }

        vector<int> cnt(n);
        long long ans = n;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int j = lps[i];
            ans += cnt[i] = j == 0 ? 0 : cnt[j - 1] + 1;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
