Given the binary representation of an integer as a string $s$, return the number of steps to reduce it to $1$ under the following rules:

- If the current number is even, you have to divide it by $2$.
- If the current number is odd, you have to add $1$ to it.

It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSteps(string s) {
        int cnt = 0;
        
        // revers it so that we can handle the carry easier.
        reverse(begin(s), end(s));
        
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < s.size() - 1)
        {
            // is even? good, use rule 1.
            if (s[i] == '0')
            {
                ++ cnt;
            }
            // is odd? a little more complicated task must be done.
            else
            {
                // add one
                int c = 1;
                
                // pass on the carry
                for (int j = i + 1; j < s.size() && c; ++j)
                {
                    // this three lines are kind of ugly...
                    int d = s[j] - '0' + c;
                    c = d / 2;
                    s[j] = (d % 2) + '0';
                }
                
                // the ultimate unhandled carry
                if (c)
                    s.push_back('1');
                
                // count 2 because we performed rule 1 and rule 2
                cnt += 2;
            }
            
            ++ i;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
