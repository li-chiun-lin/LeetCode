# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ consisting of $3 \times n$ elements.

You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly $n$ from nums. The remaining $2 \times n$ elements will be divided into two equal parts:

- The first $n$ elements belonging to the first part and their sum is $sum_{first}$.
- The next $n$ elements belonging to the second part and their sum is $sum_{second}$.

The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as $sum_{first} - sum_{second}$.

Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of $n$ elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
        priority_queue<int> left;
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<>> right;
        int n3 = size(nums);
        int n = n3 / 3;
        int n2 = n * 2;
        long long sum_l = 0, sum_r = 0;
        long long ans = LLONG_MAX;
        vector<long long> dp(n3);

        for (int i = n3 - 1; i >= n; --i)
        {
            right.push(nums[i]);
            sum_r += nums[i];

            if (size(right) > n)
            {
                sum_r -= right.top();
                right.pop();
            }

            if (size(right) == n)
                dp[i] = sum_r;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n2; ++i)
        {
            left.push(nums[i]);
            sum_l += nums[i];

            if (size(left) > n)
            {
                sum_l -= left.top();
                left.pop();
            }

            if (size(left) == n)
                ans = min(ans, sum_l - dp[i + 1]);
