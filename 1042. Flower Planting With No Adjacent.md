You have $n$ gardens, labeled from $1$ to $n$, and an array $paths$ where $paths[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ describes a bidirectional path between garden $x_i$ to garden $y_i$. In each garden, you want to plant one of $4$ types of flowers.

All gardens have at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return any such a choice as an array $answer$, where $answer[i]$ is the type of flower planted in the $(i+1)$-th garden. The flower types are denoted **1, 2, 3, or 4**. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

        // end case
        if (u >= n)
            return true;
        
        // for each possible color,
        for (int c = 1; c <= 4; ++c)
