# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed array $usageLimits$ of length $n$.

Your task is to create groups using numbers from $0$ to $n - 1$, ensuring that each number, $i$, is used no more than $usageLimits[i]$ times in total across all groups. You must also satisfy the following conditions:

- Each group must consist of distinct numbers, meaning that no duplicate numbers are allowed within a single group.
- Each group (except the first one) must have a length strictly greater than the previous group.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of groups you can create while satisfying these conditions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxIncreasingGroups(vector<int>& usageLimits) {
        sort(begin(usageLimits), end(usageLimits));

        long long total = 0;
        long long cnt = 0;

        for (auto x : usageLimits)
        {
            total += x;

            if (total >= (cnt + 1) * (cnt + 2) / 2)
                ++ cnt;
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
```
