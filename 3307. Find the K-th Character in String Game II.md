# Hard

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

You are given a positive integer $k$. You are also given an integer array $operations$, where $operations[i]$ represents the type of the $i$-th operation.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform all operations in sequence:

- If $operations[i] == 0$, append a copy of word to itself.
- If $operations[i] == 1$, generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.

Return the value of the $k$-th character in word after performing all the operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char kthCharacter(long long k, vector<int>& operations) {
        int cnt = 0;

        -- k;

        for (auto p : operations)
        {
            if (k & 1)
                cnt += p;

            k >>= 1;
        }

        return 'a' + cnt % 26;
    }
};
```
