# Hard

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

You are given a positive integer $k$. You are also given an integer array $operations$, where $operations[i]$ represents the type of the $i$-th operation.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform all operations in sequence:

- If $operations[i] == 0$, append a copy of word to itself.
- If $operations[i] == 1$, generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.

Return the value of the $k$-th character in word after performing all the operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Returns the k-th character based on binary-decoded operations and modulo-26 shifting
    char kthCharacter(long long k, const vector<int>& operations) {
        int totalShift = 0;
        --k;  // Convert from 1-based to 0-based index

        // Traverse each operation in reverse-binary order
        for (int shiftAmount : operations) {
            // If the lowest bit of k is 1, apply this operation
            if (k & 1) {
                totalShift += shiftAmount;
            }

            // Right shift to process the next bit
            k >>= 1;
        }

        // Map total shift to a lowercase letter (mod 26 ensures wraparound)
        return 'a' + (totalShift % 26);
    }
};
```
