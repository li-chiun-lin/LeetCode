# Hard

You are given a $rows \times cols$ matrix $grid$ representing a field of cherries where $grid[i][j]$ represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the $(i, j)$ cell.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:

- Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner $(0, 0)$, and
- Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner $(0, cols - 1)$.

Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:

- From a cell $(i, j)$, robots can move to cell $(i + 1, j - 1)$, $(i + 1, j)$, or $(i + 1, j + 1)$.
- When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.
- When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.
- Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
- Both robots should reach the bottom row in $grid$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int cherryPickup(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int row = grid.size();
        int col = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(row + 1, vector<vector<int>>(col + 2, vector<int>(col + 2)));
        
        for (int i = row - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            for (int j1 = 0; j1 < col; ++j1)
            {
                for (int j2 = 0; j2 < col; ++j2)
                {
                    int m = 0;
                    
                    for (int d1 = -1; d1 <= 1; ++d1)
                        for (int d2 = -1; d2 <= 1; ++d2)
                            m = max(m, dp[i + 1][j1 + d1 + 1][j2 + d2 + 1]);
                    
                    dp[i][j1 + 1][j2 + 1] = m + grid[i][j1] + (j1 == j2 ? 0 : grid[i][j2]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][1][col];
    }
};
```
