# Hard

In a project, you have a list of required skills $req_skills$, and a list of people. The $i$-th person $people[i]$ contains a list of skills that the person has.

Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in $req_skills$, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the index of each person.

Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person. You may return the answer in any order.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> smallestSufficientTeam(vector<string>& req_skills, vector<vector<string>>& people) {
        map<string, int> id;
        int n = req_skills.size();

        vector<vector<int>> dp(1 << n);
        vector<bool> visited(1 << n);
        visited[0] = true;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            id[req_skills[i]] = i;

        for (int i = 0; i < people.size(); ++i)
        {
            int cur = 0;

            for (auto& s : people[i])
                cur |= 1 << id[s];

            for (int j = 0; j < dp.size(); ++j)
            {
                if (! visited[j])
                    continue;

                int cmb = cur | j;

                if (! visited[cmb] || dp[cmb].size() > 1 + dp[j].size())
                {
                    dp[cmb] = dp[j];
                    dp[cmb].push_back(i);
                    visited[cmb] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return dp.back();
    }
};
```
