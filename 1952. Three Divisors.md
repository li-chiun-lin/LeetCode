# Easy

Given an integer *n*, return **true** if *n* has **exactly three positive divisors**. Otherwise, return **false**.

An integer *m* is a divisor of *n* if there exists an integer *k* such that *n = k * m*.

## My Solution

We don't have to check *1* and *n*,
so, the question is in fact asking us whether there is only one divisor in (*1, n*).
and this approach also luckily avoid the corner case when *n* == *1*.
We might consider to use the prime sieve if the scale goes up,
but for now, this is enough.

```cpp
int c = 0;
        
for (int i = 2; i < n && c < 2; ++i)
    if (n % i == 0)
        ++ c;

return c == 1;
```

And after we further examming the question,
we observe that the two default dvisors, i.e. *1* and *n*, are indeed paired up together,
meaning that *n == 1 * n*.
And with this fact, it only leaves *1* last slot for the third divisor.
Assuming *d* is the third divisor such that *n % d == 0* and *d != 1* and *d != n*,
that means there is an *q* such that *n == d * q*,
So, the only result that fullfil the requirment is *d == q*.
Thus, we have our elegant code.

```cpp
for (int d = 2; d < n; ++i)
    if (n % d == 0)
        return d * d == n;

return false;
```
