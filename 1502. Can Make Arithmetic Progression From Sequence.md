A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers $arr$, return $true$ if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMakeArithmeticProgression(vector<int>& arr) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int diff = arr[1] - arr[0];
        
        for (int i = 2; i < arr.size(); ++i)
            if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] != diff)
                return false;
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
