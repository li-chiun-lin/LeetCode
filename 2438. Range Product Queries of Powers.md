Given a positive integer $n$, there exists a 0-indexed array called $powers$, composed of the minimum number of powers of $2$ that sum to $n$. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is only one way to form the array.

You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $queries$, where $queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]$. Each $queries[i]$ represents a query where you have to find the product of all $powers[j]$ with $left_i \leq j \leq right_i$.

Return an array $answers$, equal in length to queries, where $answers[i]$ is the answer to the $i$-th query. Since the answer to the $i$-th query may be too large, each $answers[i]$ should be returned modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productQueries(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> ret;
        vector<unsigned long long> powers;
        unsigned long long p = 1UL;
        
        while (n)
        {
            if (n & 1)
                powers.push_back(p);
            
            p <<= 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        int m = powers.size();
        
        for (auto& q : queries)
        {
            unsigned long long p = 1UL;
            
            for (int i = q[0]; i <= q[1]; ++i)
                p = (p * powers[i]) % mod;
            
            ret.push_back(p);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
