You are given two strings $s$ and $p$ where $p$ is a subsequence of $s$. You are also given a distinct 0-indexed integer array $removable$ containing a subset of indices of $s$.

You want to choose an integer $k$ ($0 \leq k \leq removable.length$) such that, after removing $k$ characters from $s$ using the first $k$ indices in $removable$, $p$ is still a subsequence of $s$. More formally, you will mark the character at $s[removable[i]]$ for each $0 \leq i < k$, then remove all marked characters and check if $p$ is still a subsequence.

Return the maximum $k$ you can choose such that $p$ is still a subsequence of $s$ after the removals.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumRemovals(string s, string p, vector<int>& removable) {
        int n = size(s);
        int nn = size(p);
        int nnn = size(removable);
        vector<int> idx(n, INT_MAX);

        for (int i = 0; i < nnn; ++i)
            idx[removable[i]] = i;

        int l = 0;
        int r = nnn;

        while (l < r)
        {
            int m = (l + r + 1) / 2;
            int j = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < n && j < nn; ++i)
                if (idx[i] >= m && s[i] == p[j])
                    ++j;

            if (j == nn)
                l = m;
            else
                r = m - 1;
        }

        return l;
    }
};
```
