Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories.

Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form $name.extension$, where $name$ and $extension$ consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

Given a string $input$ representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthLongestPath(string input) {
        string tok = "";
        int ct = 0;
        vector<int> len(input.size());
        bool isFile = false;
        int m = 0;
        
        input += '\n';
        
        for (int i = 0; i < input.size(); ++i)
        {
            if (input[i] == '\n')
            {
                if (isFile)
                {
                    int s = tok.size();
                    for (int j = 0; j < ct; ++j)
                        s += len[j];
                    
                    m = max(m, s);
                }
                else
                    len[ct] = tok.size() + 1;
                
                ct = 0;
                tok = "";
                isFile = false;
            }
            else if(input[i] == '\t')
            {
                ++ ct;
            }
            else
            {
                if (input[i] == '.')
                    isFile = true;
                
                tok += input[i];
            }
        }
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
