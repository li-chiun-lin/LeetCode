# Medium

You are given an integer array $pizzas$ of size $n$, where $pizzas[i]$ represents the weight of the $i$-th pizza. Every day, you eat exactly $4$ pizzas. Due to your incredible metabolism, when you eat pizzas of weights $W$, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, where $W \leq X \leq Y \leq Z$, you gain the weight of only $1$ pizza!

- On odd-numbered days (1-indexed), you gain a weight of $Z$.
- On even-numbered days, you gain a weight of $Y$.

Find the maximum total weight you can gain by eating all pizzas optimally.

Note: It is guaranteed that $n$ is a multiple of 4, and each pizza can be eaten only once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxWeight(vector<int>& pizzas) {
        long long ans = 0;  // Variable to store the maximum weight
        int n = size(pizzas);  // Get the size of the pizzas vector
        int days = n / 4;  // Calculate the number of days
        int odd_days = (days + 1) / 2;  // Half of the days, rounded up
        int even_days = days - odd_days;  // The other half (rounded down)

        sort(begin(pizzas), end(pizzas));  // Sort pizzas in ascending order

        // Loop over the odd days, adding the largest available pizzas to the answer
        for (int i = 0; i < odd_days; ++i) {
            ans += pizzas[n - 1 - i];  // Add the largest pizzas (starting from the end of the sorted list)
        }

        // Loop over the even days, adding the next available pizzas to the answer
        for (int i = 0, idx = n - 1 - odd_days; i < even_days; ++i) {
            ans += pizzas[idx - 1];  // Add the next largest pizza (skip 1 to ensure we're adding non-overlapping pizzas)
            idx -= 2;  // Move the index back by 2 to select the next available pizza
        }
        
        return ans;  // Return the total weight
    }
};
```
