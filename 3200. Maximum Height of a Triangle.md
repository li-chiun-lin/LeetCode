# Easy

You are given two integers $red$ and $blue$ representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1st row will have 1 ball, the 2nd row will have 2 balls, the 3rd row will have 3 balls, and so on.

All the balls in a particular row should be the same color, and adjacent rows should have different colors.

Return the maximum height of the triangle that can be achieved.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int cnt(int r, int b)
    {
        vector<int> ball = {r, b};
        int height = 0;
        
        while (ball[height % 2] >= (height + 1))
        {
            ball[height % 2] -= height + 1;
            ++ height;
        }
        
        return height;
    }
    
public:
    int maxHeightOfTriangle(int red, int blue) {
        return max(cnt(red, blue), cnt(blue, red));
    }
};
```
