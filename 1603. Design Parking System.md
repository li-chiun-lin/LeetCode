# Easy

Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the **ParkingSystem** class:

- **ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)** Initializes object of the **ParkingSystem** class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
- **bool addCar(int carType)** Checks whether there is a parking space of **carType** for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. **carType** can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by **1, 2, and 3** respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its **carType**. If there is no space available, return **false**, else park the car in that size space and return **true**.

```cpp
class ParkingSystem {
    int b;
    int m;
    int s;
public:
    ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) {
        b = big;
        m = medium;
        s = small;
    }
    
    bool addCar(int carType) {
        if (carType == 1)
            return --b >= 0;
        else if (carType == 2)
            return --m >= 0;
        else if (carType == 3)
            return --s >= 0;
        else
            return false;
    }
};
```
