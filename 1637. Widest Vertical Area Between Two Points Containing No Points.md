# Medium

Given $n$ $points$ on a 2D plane where $points[i] = [x_i, y_i]$, Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        vector<int> x;
        
        for (auto &p : points)
            x.push_back(p[0]);
        
        sort(begin(x), end(x));
        
        int m = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < x.size(); ++i)
            m = max(m, x[i] - x[i - 1]);
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
