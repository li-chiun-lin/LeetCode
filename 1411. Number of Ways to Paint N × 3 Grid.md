# Hard

You have a $grid$ of size $n \times 3$ and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given $n$ the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this $grid$. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfWays(int n) {
        vector<long long> ABA(2), ABC(2);
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        int cur = 0;
        int pre = 1;

        ABA[pre] = 6;
        ABC[pre] = 6;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            ABA[cur] = (ABA[pre] * 3 + ABC[pre] * 2) % m;
            ABC[cur] = (ABA[pre] * 2 + ABC[pre] * 2) % m;

            pre = cur;
            cur = 1 - pre;
        }

        return (ABA[pre] + ABC[pre]) % m;
    }
};
```
