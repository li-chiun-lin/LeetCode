# Hard

There is an undirected graph with $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$ (inclusive). You are given a 0-indexed integer array $values$ where $values[i]$ is the value of the $i$-th node. You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $edges$, where each $edges[j] = [u_j, v_j, time_j]$ indicates that there is an undirected edge between the nodes $u_j$ and $v_j$, and it takes $time_j$ seconds to travel between the two nodes. Finally, you are given an integer $maxTime$.

A valid path in the graph is any path that starts at node $0$, ends at node $0$, and takes at most $maxTime$ seconds to complete. You may visit the same node multiple times. The quality of a valid path is the sum of the values of the unique nodes visited in the path (each node's value is added at most once to the sum).

Return the maximum quality of a valid path.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalPathQuality(vector<int>& values, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int maxTime) {
        int n = size(values);
        int ans = values[0];
        vector<int> visited(n);
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back({e[1], e[2]});
            adj[e[1]].push_back({e[0], e[2]});
        }

        function<void(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int u, int s, int t)
        {
            if (visited[u] == 0)
                s += values[u];

            ++ visited[u];

            if (u == 0)
                ans = max(ans, s);

            for (auto [v, tt] : adj[u])
                if (t + tt <= maxTime)
                    dfs(v, s, t + tt);

            -- visited[u];
        };

        dfs(0, 0, 0);

        return ans;
    }
};
```
