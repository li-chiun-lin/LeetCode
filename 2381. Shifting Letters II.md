You are given a string $s$ of lowercase English letters and a 2D integer array $shifts$ where $shifts[i] = [start_i, end_i, direction_i]$. For every $i$, shift the characters in $s$ from the index $start_i$ to the index $end_i$ (inclusive) forward if $directioni = 1$, or shift the characters backward if $directioni = 0$.

Shifting a character forward means replacing it with the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that **'z'** becomes **'a'**). Similarly, shifting a character backward means replacing it with the previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that **'a'** becomes **'z'**).

Return the final string after all such shifts to $s$ are applied.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string shiftingLetters(string s, vector<vector<int>>& shifts) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> acc(n + 1);
        
        for (auto& sh : shifts)
        {
            int d = sh[2] ? 1 : -1;
            
            acc[sh[0]] += d;
            acc[sh[1] + 1] -= d;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            acc[i] = (acc[i] + acc[i - 1]) % 26;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int v = (s[i] - 'a' + acc[i]) % 26;
            v = (v + 26) % 26;
            s[i] = v + 'a';
        }
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
