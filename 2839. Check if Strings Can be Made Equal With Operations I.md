# Easy

You are given two strings $s1$ and $s2$, both of length $4$, consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can apply the following operation on any of the two strings any number of times:

- Choose any two indices $i$ and $j$ such that $j - i = 2$, then swap the two characters at those indices in the string.

Return $true$ if you can make the strings $s1$ and $s2$ equal, and $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeEqual(string s1, string s2) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
        {
            if (s1[i] != s2[i])
            {
                int j = i + 2;
                
                if (j >= 4 || s1[j] != s2[i])
                    return false;
                else
                {
                    s1[j] = s1[i];
                    //swap(s1[i], s1[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
