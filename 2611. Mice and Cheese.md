There are two mice and $n$ different types of cheese, each type of cheese should be eaten by exactly one mouse.

A point of the cheese with index $i$ (0-indexed) is:

- $reward1[i]$ if the first mouse eats it.
- $reward2[i]$ if the second mouse eats it.

You are given a positive integer array $reward1$, a positive integer array $reward2$, and a non-negative integer $k$.

Return the maximum points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats exactly $k$ types of cheese.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int miceAndCheese(vector<int>& reward1, vector<int>& reward2, int k) {
        int n = reward1.size();
        vector<int> dif(n);
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            // first, we assum the second mouse eats all.
            ret += reward2[i];
            // what will be the difference if the first mouse eats this cheese?
            dif[i] = reward1[i] - reward2[i];
            
        }

        // sort the differences, so we can have the first k largest difference.
        sort(begin(dif), end(dif), greater<>());

        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
            ret += dif[i];
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
