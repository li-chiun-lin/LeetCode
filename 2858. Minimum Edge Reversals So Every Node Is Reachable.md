# Hard

There is a simple directed graph with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$. The graph would form a tree if its edges were bi-directional.

You are given an integer $n$ and a 2D integer array $edges$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ represents a directed edge going from node $u_i$ to node $v_i$.

An edge reversal changes the direction of an edge.

For every node $i$ in the range $[0, n - 1]$, your task is to independently calculate the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node $i$ through a sequence of directed edges.

Return an integer array $answer$, where $answer[i]$ is the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node $i$ through a sequence of directed edges.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(int u, int p, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& adj, map<pair<int, int>, int>& dp)
    {
        if (dp.find({u, p}) != end(dp))
            return dp[{u, p}];

        int ret = 0;

        // r = 0 : direct traversal
        // r = 1 : reverse traversal
        for (int r = 0; r <= 1; ++r)
            for (auto v : adj[r][u])
                if (v != p)
                    ret += dfs(v, u, adj, dp) + r;

        return dp[{u, p}] = ret;
    }

public:
    vector<int> minEdgeReversals(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> adj(2, vector<vector<int>>(n));
        map<pair<int, int>, int> dp;
        vector<int> ret;

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[0][e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[1][e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ret.push_back(dfs(i, -1, adj, dp));

        return ret;
    }
};
```
