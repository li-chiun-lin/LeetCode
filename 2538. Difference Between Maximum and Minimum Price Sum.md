# Hard

There exists an undirected and initially unrooted tree with $n$ nodes indexed from $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given the integer $n$ and a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree.

Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array $price$, where $price[i]$ is the price of the $i$-th node.

The price sum of a given path is the sum of the prices of all nodes lying on that path.

The tree can be rooted at any node $root$ of your choice. The incurred cost after choosing $root$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum price sum amongst all paths starting at $root$.

Return the maximum possible cost amongst all possible root choices.

```cpp
class Solution {
    pair<long long, long long> dfs(int p, int u, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& price, long long& ret)
    {
        // the current node is a valid path.
        long long max_path_sum_so_far = price[u];
        // exclude this current node so it could be one end point of the optimized path.
        long long max_path_sum_without_endpoint_so_far = 0;
        // both of them must be maximized.

        for (auto v : adj[u])
        {
            if (v == p)
                continue;

            auto [s, w] = dfs(u, v, adj, price, ret);

            // an end point has been excluded at the far end of this just visited subtree.
            ret = max(ret, max_path_sum_so_far + w);
            // an end point has been excluded at the far end of some previous visited subtree.
            ret = max(ret, max_path_sum_without_endpoint_so_far + s);

            // the max path sum up till this current node.
            max_path_sum_so_far = max(max_path_sum_so_far, s + price[u]);
            // the max path sum without an end point.
            max_path_sum_without_endpoint_so_far = max(max_path_sum_without_endpoint_so_far, w + price[u]);
        }

        return {max_path_sum_so_far, max_path_sum_without_endpoint_so_far};
    }
public:
    long long maxOutput(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& price) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        long long ret = 0;

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        dfs(-1, 0, adj, price, ret);
