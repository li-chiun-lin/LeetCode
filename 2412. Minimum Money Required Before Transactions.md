# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $transactions$, where $transactions[i] = [cost_i, cashback_i]$.

The array describes transactions, where each transaction must be completed exactly once in some order. At any given moment, you have a certain amount of $money$. In order to complete transaction $i$, $money \geq cost_i$ must hold true. After performing a transaction, $money$ becomes $money - cost_i + cashback_i$.

Return the minimum amount of $money$ required before any transaction so that all of the transactions can be completed regardless of the order of the transactions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumMoney(vector<vector<int>>& transactions) {
        long long ret = 0;
        int v = 0;
        
        for (auto& t : transactions)
        {
            int cost = t[0];
            int cashback = t[1];
            
            v = max(v, min(cost, cashback));
            ret += max(cost - cashback, 0);
        }
        
        return ret + v;
    }
};
```
