# Easy

You are working in a ball factory where you have $n$ balls numbered from $lowLimit$ up to $highLimit$ inclusive (i.e., $n == highLimit - lowLimit + 1$), and an infinite number of boxes numbered from $1$ to $infinity$.

Your job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number.

Given two integers $lowLimit$ and $highLimit$, return the number of balls in the box with the most balls.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // the digit sum
    int cal(int n)
    {
        int d = 0;
        
        while (n)
        {
            d += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        
        return d;
    }
    
    int countBalls(int lowLimit, int highLimit) {
        map<int, int> hist;
        
        for (int i = lowLimit; i <= highLimit; ++i)
            ++ hist[cal(i)];
            
        int m = 0;
        
        for (auto &h : hist)
            m = max(m, h.second);
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
