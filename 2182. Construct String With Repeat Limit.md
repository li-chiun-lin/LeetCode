# Medium

You are given a string $s$ and an integer $repeatLimit$. Construct a new string $repeatLimitedString$ using the characters of $s$ such that no letter appears more than $repeatLimit$ times in a row. You do not have to use all characters from $s$.

Return the lexicographically largest $repeatLimitedString$ possible.

A string $a$ is lexicographically larger than a string $b$ if in the first position where $a$ and $b$ differ, string $a$ has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $b$. If the first $\min(a.length, b.length)$ characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically larger one.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string repeatLimitedString(string s, int repeatLimit) {
        // Count the frequency of each character in the string
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char c : s)
            ++freq[c - 'a'];

        // Create a max-heap to store characters by their frequency
        priority_queue<pair<char, int>> maxHeap;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
            if (freq[i])
                maxHeap.emplace('a' + i, freq[i]);

        string result;
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            // Extract the character with the highest frequency
            auto [ch1, count1] = maxHeap.top(); maxHeap.pop();
            
            // Determine how many times to take the current character
            int take = min(count1, repeatLimit);
            result.append(take, ch1);
            count1 -= take;

            // If there are still occurrences left for the current character
            if (count1 > 0) {
                // If there are no more characters left, stop
                if (maxHeap.empty())
                    break;

                // Use the next most frequent character to break the sequence
                auto [ch2, count2] = maxHeap.top(); maxHeap.pop();
                result.push_back(ch2);

                // Return the second character to the heap if needed
                if (--count2 > 0)
                    maxHeap.emplace(ch2, count2);

                // Reinsert the original character with remaining occurrences
                maxHeap.emplace(ch1, count1);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
