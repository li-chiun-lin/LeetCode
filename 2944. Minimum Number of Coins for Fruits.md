You are at a fruit market with different types of exotic fruits on display.

You are given a 1-indexed array $prices$, where $prices[i]$ denotes the number of coins needed to purchase the $i$-th fruit.

The fruit market has the following offer:

- If you purchase the $i$-th fruit at $prices[i]$ coins, you can get the next $i$ fruits for free.

Note that even if you can take fruit $j$ for free, you can still purchase it for $prices[j]$ coins to receive a new offer.

Return the minimum number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(vector<int>& prices, int i, int free, vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        if (i == size(prices))
            return 0;
        
        if (dp[i][free] != -1)
            return dp[i][free];

        int r1 = INT_MAX;
        
        // take it for free
        if (free)
            r1 = dfs(prices, i + 1, free - 1, dp);

        // purchase it
        int r2 = dfs(prices, i + 1, i + 1, dp) + prices[i];
        
        return dp[i][free] = min(r1, r2);
    }

public:
    int minimumCoins(vector<int>& prices) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(size(prices), vector<int>(size(prices) + 1, -1));
        return dfs(prices, 0, 0, dp);
    }
};
