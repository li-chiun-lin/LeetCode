Given an integer array $nums$ where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        unsigned int mask = 1;
        int ret = 0;
        
        while (mask)
        {
            int cnt = 0;
            
            for (int n : nums)
                if (n & mask)
                    ++ cnt;
            
            if (cnt % 3)
                ret |= mask;
            
            mask <<= 1;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
