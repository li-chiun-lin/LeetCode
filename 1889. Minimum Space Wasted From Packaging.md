# Hard

You have $n$ packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package in each box. There are $m$ suppliers that each produce boxes of different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box.

The package sizes are given as an integer array $packages$, where $packages[i]$ is the size of the $i$-th package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array $boxes$, where $boxes[j]$ is an array of box sizes that the $j$-th supplier produces.

You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.

Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally, or $-1$ if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minWastedSpace(vector<int>& packages, vector<vector<int>>& boxes) {
        sort(begin(packages), end(packages));
        long long ans = LLONG_MAX;
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        long long sum = accumulate(begin(packages), end(packages), 0LL);

        for (auto& supplier : boxes)
        {
            sort(begin(supplier), end(supplier));

            if (supplier.back() < packages.back())
                continue;

            long long cur = 0;
            int l = 0;

            for (long long b : supplier)
            {
                int r = upper_bound(begin(packages) + l, end(packages), b) - begin(packages);
                cur += b * (r - l);
                l = r;
            }

            ans = min(ans, cur);
        }

        return ans == LLONG_MAX ? -1 : (ans - sum) % mod;
    }
};
```
