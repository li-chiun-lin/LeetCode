You are given a $m \times n$ 0-indexed 2D matrix $mat$. From every cell, you can create numbers in the following way:

- There could be at most 8 paths from the cells namely: east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east.
- Select a path from them and append digits in this path to the number being formed by traveling in this direction.
- Note that numbers are generated at every step.

Return the most frequent prime number greater than $10$ out of all the numbers created by traversing the matrix or $-1$ if no such prime number exists. If there are multiple prime numbers with the highest frequency, then return the largest among them.

Note: It is invalid to change the direction during the move.
