You have a data structure of employee information, including the employee's unique ID, importance value, and direct subordinates' IDs.

You are given an array of employees $employees$ where:

- $employees[i].id$ is the ID of the $i$-th employee.
- $employees[i].importance$ is the importance value of the $i$-th employee.
- $employees[i].subordinates$ is a list of the IDs of the direct subordinates of the $i$-th employee.

Given an integer $id$ that represents an employee's ID, return the total importance value of this employee and all their direct and indirect subordinates.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        int sum = 0;
        int idx = 0;
        
        while (employees[idx]->id != id)
            ++ idx;
        
        for (int x : employees[idx]->subordinates)
            sum += getImportance(employees, x);
            
        
        return employees[idx]->importance + sum;
    }
};
```
