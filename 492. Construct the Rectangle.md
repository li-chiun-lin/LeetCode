A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
1. The width $W$ should not be larger than the length $L$, which means $L \geq W$.
1. The difference between length $L$ and width $W$ should be as small as possible.

Return an array $[L, W]$ where $L$ and $W$ are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> constructRectangle(int area) {
        int w = 1;
        int l = 0;
        
        while (w * w <= area)
        {
            if (area % w == 0)
                l = area / w;
            
            ++ w;
        }
        
        return {l, area / l};
    }
};
```
