# Hard

You are given two integers $m$ and $n$ that represent the height and width of a rectangular piece of wood. You are also given a 2D integer array $prices$, where $prices[i] = [h_i, w_i, price_i]$ indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height $h_i$ and width $w_i$ for pricei dollars.

To cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the entire height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to $prices$. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you cannot rotate a piece to swap its height and width.

Return the maximum money you can earn after cutting an $m \times n$ piece of wood.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long sellingWood(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& prices) {
        vector<vector<long long>> dp(m + 1, vector<long long>(n + 1));

        for (auto& p : prices)
            dp[p[0]][p[1]] = p[2];

        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
            {
                for (int k = 1; k <= i / 2; ++k)
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[k][j] + dp[i - k][j]);

                for (int k = 1; k <= j / 2; ++k)
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[i][j - k]);
            }

        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
