# Hard

Given an integer array $nums$, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form. If the array contains less than two elements, return $0$.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumGap(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() < 2)
            return 0;
        
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums), greater<>());
        
        int diff = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i)
        {
            diff = nums[i - 1] - nums[i];
            ret = max(ret, diff);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
