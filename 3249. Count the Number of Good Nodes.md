There is an undirected tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$, and rooted at node $0$. You are given a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree.

A node is good if all the subtrees rooted at its children have the same size.

Return the number of good nodes in the given tree.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& adj, int u, int p, int& ans)
    {
        set<int> sub;
        int sum = 0;

        for (auto v : adj[u])
            if (v != p)
            {
                int c = dfs(adj, v, u, ans);
                sub.insert(c);
                sum += c;
            }
        
        if (size(sub) <= 1)
            ++ ans;

        return sum + 1;
    }
    
public:
    int countGoodNodes(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = size(edges) + 1;
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        
        dfs(adj, 0, -1, ans);
        
        return ans;
