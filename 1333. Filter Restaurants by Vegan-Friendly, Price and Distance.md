Given the array $restaurants$ where $restaurants[i] = [id_i, rating_i, veganFriendly_i, price_i, distance_i]$. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.

The $veganFriendly$ filter will be either $true$ (meaning you should only include restaurants with $veganFriendly_i$ set to $true$) or $false$ (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters $maxPrice$ and $maxDistance$ which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.

Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by $rating$ from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same $rating$, order them by $id$ from highest to lowest. For simplicity $veganFriendly_i$ and $veganFriendly$ take value $1$ when it is $true$, and $0$ when it is $false$.

```cpp
bool cmp(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b)
{
    if (a[1] == b[1])
        return a[0] > b[0];
    
    return a[1] > b[1];
}

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> filterRestaurants(vector<vector<int>>& restaurants, int veganFriendly, int maxPrice, int maxDistance) {
        vector<vector<int>> filter;
        vector<int> ret;
        
        for (auto& r : restaurants)
            if ((veganFriendly == 0 || r[2]) && r[3] <= maxPrice && r[4] <= maxDistance)
                filter.push_back(r);
        
        sort(begin(filter), end(filter), cmp);
        
        for (auto& f : filter)
            ret.push_back(f[0]);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
