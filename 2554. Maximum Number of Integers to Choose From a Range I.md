You are given an integer array $banned$ and two integers $n$ and $maxSum$. You are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:

- The chosen integers have to be in the range $[1, n]$.
- Each integer can be chosen at most once.
- The chosen integers should not be in the array $banned$.
- The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed $maxSum$.

Return the maximum number of integers you can choose following the mentioned rules.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCount(vector<int>& banned, int n, int maxSum) {
        set<int> ss(begin(banned), end(banned));
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n && maxSum >= i; ++i)
        {
            if (ss.count(i))
                continue;
            
            ++ cnt;
            maxSum -= i;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
