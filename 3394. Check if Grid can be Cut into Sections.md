# Medium

You are given an integer $n$ representing the dimensions of an $n \times n$ grid, with the origin at the bottom-left corner of the grid. You are also given a 2D array of coordinates $rectangles$, where $rectangles[i]$ is in the form $[start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y]$, representing a rectangle on the grid. Each rectangle is defined as follows:

- (start_x, start_y): The bottom-left corner of the rectangle.
- (end_x, end_y): The top-right corner of the rectangle.

Note that the rectangles do not overlap. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either two horizontal or two vertical cuts on the grid such that:

- Each of the three resulting sections formed by the cuts contains at least one rectangle.
- Every rectangle belongs to exactly one section.

Return $true$ if such cuts can be made; otherwise, return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Function to count the number of valid cuts in one dimension
    int countValidCuts(const vector<pair<int, int>>& segments) {
        int cuts = 0, lastEnd = -1;

        for (const auto& [start, end] : segments) {
            if (lastEnd <= start) {
                ++cuts;
            }
            lastEnd = max(lastEnd, end);
        }

        return cuts;
    }

public:
    bool checkValidCuts(int n, const vector<vector<int>>& rectangles) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> xs, ys;

        // Extract horizontal and vertical segments
        for (const auto& rect : rectangles) {
            xs.emplace_back(rect[0], rect[2]);
            ys.emplace_back(rect[1], rect[3]);
        }

        // Sort segments by their starting points
        sort(xs.begin(), xs.end());
        sort(ys.begin(), ys.end());

        // Check if either horizontal or vertical cuts are sufficient
        return countValidCuts(xs) >= 3 || countValidCuts(ys) >= 3;
    }
};
```
