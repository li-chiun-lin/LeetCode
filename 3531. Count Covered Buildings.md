# Medium

You are given a positive integer $n$, representing an $n \times n$ city. You are also given a 2D grid $buildings$, where $buildings[i] = [x, y]$ denotes a unique building located at coordinates $[x, y]$.

A building is covered if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.

Return the number of covered buildings.

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    int countCoveredBuildings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& buildings)
    {
        // Initialize row and column range trackers
        // Each row and column keeps track of its minimum and maximum occupied coordinate
        vector<pair<int, int>> rowRange(n + 1, {INT_MAX, INT_MIN});
        vector<pair<int, int>> colRange(n + 1, {INT_MAX, INT_MIN});

        // Process each building to update row and column coverage
        for (auto& building : buildings)
        {
            int r = building[0];
            int c = building[1];
            rowRange[r].first = min(rowRange[r].first, c);
            rowRange[r].second = max(rowRange[r].second, c);
            colRange[c].first = min(colRange[c].first, r);
            colRange[c].second = max(colRange[c].second, r);
        }

        int coveredCount = 0;  // Number of buildings that are covered

        // Check each building if it is strictly between min and max in both its row and column
        for (auto& building : buildings)
        {
            int r = building[0];
            int c = building[1];

            if (rowRange[r].first < c && c < rowRange[r].second &&
                colRange[c].first < r && r < colRange[c].second)
            {
                ++coveredCount;
            }
        }

        return coveredCount;
    }
};
