# Medium

You are given a binary string $s$ and a positive integer $k$.

Return the length of the longest subsequence of $s$ that makes up a binary number less than or equal to $k$.

Note:

- The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
- The empty string is considered to be equal to $0$.
- A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();

        // Count all '0's â€” they can always be included
        int count0 = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '0');
        int count1 = 0;      // Count of '1's we can include
        int bitValue = 0;    // Running total binary value
        int weight = 1;      // 2^0, 2^1, ..., from LSB

        // Traverse from right to left (least significant bit first)
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0 && weight <= k; --i, weight <<= 1) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                // Check if including this '1' exceeds the value k
                if (bitValue + weight <= k) {
                    bitValue += weight;
                    ++count1;
                }
                // Else skip this '1'
            }
        }

        return count0 + count1;
    }
};
```
