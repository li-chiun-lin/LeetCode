# Medium

You are given a binary string $s$ and a positive integer $k$.

Return the length of the longest subsequence of $s$ that makes up a binary number less than or equal to $k$.

Note:

- The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
- The empty string is considered to be equal to $0$.
- A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        int cnt0 = count(begin(s), end(s), '0');
        int cnt1 = 0;
        int p = 1;
        int val = 0;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0 && val + p <= k; --i, p <<= 1)
        {
            if (s[i] == '1')
            {
                ++ cnt1;
                val += p;
            }
        }
        
        return cnt0 + cnt1;
    }
};
```
