# Hard

You are given $n$ individuals at a base camp who need to cross a river to reach a destination using a single boat. The boat can carry at most $k$ people at a time. The trip is affected by environmental conditions that vary cyclically over m stages.

Each stage $j$ has a speed multiplier $mul[j]$:

- If $mul[j] > 1$, the trip slows down.
- If $mul[j] < 1$, the trip speeds up.

Each individual $i$ has a rowing strength represented by $time[i]$, the time (in minutes) it takes them to cross alone in neutral conditions.

Rules:

- A group $g$ departing at stage $j$ takes time equal to the maximum $time[i]$ among its members, multiplied by $mul[j]$ minutes to reach the destination.
- After the group crosses the river in time $d$, the stage advances by $floor(d) \mod m$ steps.
- If individuals are left behind, one person must return with the boat. Let $r$ be the index of the returning person, the return takes $time[r] \times mul[current\_stage]$, defined as $return\_time$, and the stage advances by $floor(return\_time) \mod m$.

Return the minimum total time required to transport all individuals. If it is not possible to transport all individuals to the destination, return $-1$.
