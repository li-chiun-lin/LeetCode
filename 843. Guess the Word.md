# Hard

You are given an array of unique strings $words$ where $words[i]$ is six letters long. One word of $words$ was chosen as a secret word.

You are also given the helper object $Master$. You may call $Master.guess(word)$ where $word$ is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from $words$. $Master.guess(word)$ returns:

- $-1$ if word is not from $words$, or
- an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.

There is a parameter $allowedGuesses$ for each test case where $allowedGuesses$ is the maximum number of times you can call $Master.guess(word)$.

For each test case, you should call $Master.guess$ with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:

- "Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word." if you called $Master.guess$ more than $allowedGuesses$ times or if you did not call $Master.guess$ with the secret word, or
- "You guessed the secret word correctly." if you called $Master.guess$ with the secret word with the number of calls to $Master.guess$ less than or equal to $allowedGuesses$.

The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).

```cpp
/**
 * // This is the Master's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * class Master {
 *   public:
 *     int guess(string word);

    int match(string& w1, string& w2)
    {
        return inner_product(begin(w1), end(w1), begin(w2), 0, plus<>(), equal_to<>());
    }

    string best(list<string>& ws, vector<vector<int>>& prob)
    {
        string ans;
        int ms = 0;

        for (auto& w : ws)
        {
            int s = 1;

            for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i)
                s += prob[i][w[i] - 'a'];

            if (ms < s)
            {
                ms = s;
                ans = w;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

                prob[i][w[i] - 'a'] += d;
        };

        for_each(begin(words), end(words), add);

        int ans = 0;

        while (ans < 6)
        {
            auto candidate = best(rem, prob);
            ans = master.guess(candidate);

            for (auto it = begin(rem); it != end(rem);)

                if (match(*it, candidate) != ans)
                {
                    add(*it, -1);
                    rem.erase(it ++);
                }
                else
                    ++ it;
