# Hard

There are several squares being dropped onto the X-axis of a 2D plane.

You are given a 2D integer array $positions$ where $positions[i] = [left_i, sideLength_i]$ represents the $i$-th square with a side length of $sideLength_i$ that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate $left_i$.

Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.

After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.

Return an integer array $ans$ where $ans[i]$ represents the height described above after dropping the $i$-th square.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> fallingSquares(vector<vector<int>>& positions) {
        vector<tuple<int, int, int>> vec;
        vector<int> ret;

        int h = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < positions.size(); ++i)
        {
            int si = positions[i][0];
            int hi = positions[i][1];
            int ei = si + hi - 1;

            int prv = 0;

            for (auto [sj, ej, hj] : vec)
                if (sj <= ei && si <= ej)
                    prv = max(prv, hj);

            vec.push_back({si, ei, hi + prv});
            h = max(h, hi + prv);
            ret.push_back(h);
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
```
