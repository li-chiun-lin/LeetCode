# Medium

There is a car with $capacity$ empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer $capacity$ and an array $trips$ where $trips[i] = [numPassengers_i, from_i, to_i]$ indicates that the $i$-th trip has $numPassengers_i$ passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are $from_i$ and $to_i$ respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return $true$ if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool carPooling(vector<vector<int>>& trips, int capacity) {
        int n = trips.size();
        map<int, int> hist;
        
        for (auto &t : trips)
        {
            hist[t[1]] += t[0];
            hist[t[2]] -= t[0];
        }
        
        int acc = 0;
        
        for (auto &h : hist)
            if ((acc += h.second) > capacity)
                return false;
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
