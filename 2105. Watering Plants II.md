Alice and Bob want to water **n** plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from **0** to **n - 1** from left to right where the **i**-th plant is located at **x = i**.

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:

- Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the **0**-th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the **(n - 1)**-th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.
- It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.
- Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.
- In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.

Given a 0-indexed integer array **plants** of **n** integers, where **plants[i]** is the amount of water the **i**-th plant needs, and two integers **capacityA** and **capacityB** representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumRefill(vector<int>& plants, int capacityA, int capacityB) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = plants.size() - 1;
        int ca = capacityA;
        int cb = capacityB;
        int cnt = 0;
        
        while (a < b)
        {
            if (ca >= plants[a])
            {
                ca -= plants[a];
                ++a;
            }
            else if (plants[a] <= capacityA)
            {
                ca = capacityA - plants[a];
                ++a;
                ++ cnt;
            }
            else
                ;
            
            if (cb >= plants[b])
            {
                cb -= plants[b];
                -- b;
            }
            else if(plants[b] <= capacityB)
            {
                cb = capacityB - plants[b];
                --b;
                ++ cnt;
            }
            else
                ;
        }
        
        if (a == b)
        {
            if (ca >= plants[a] || cb >= plants[b])
                ;
            else
                ++ cnt;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
