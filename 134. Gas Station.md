# Medium

There are $n$ gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the $i$-th station is $gas[i]$.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs $cost[i]$ of gas to travel from the $i$-th station to its next $(i + 1)$-th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays $gas$ and $cost$, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return $-1$. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = gas.size();
        vector<int> diff(n);
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            diff[i] = gas[i] - cost[i];
            sum += diff[i];
        }
        
        if (sum < 0)
            return -1;
        
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int len = 0;
        int acc = diff[start];
        
        while (len < n)
        {
            if (acc < 0)
            {
                acc -= diff[start];
                
                ++ start;
                start %= n;
                -- len;
            }
            else
            {
                ++ end;
                end %= n;
                ++ len;
                
                acc += diff[end];
            }
        }
        
        return start;
    }
};
```
