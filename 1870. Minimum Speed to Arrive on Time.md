# Medium

You are given a floating-point number **hour**, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take **n** trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array **dist** of length **n**, where **dist[i]** describes the distance (in kilometers) of the **i**-th train ride.

Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.

Return the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour) that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or **-1** if it is impossible to be on time.

```cpp
class Solution {
    double totalTime(vector<int>& dist, int speed)
    {
        double s = 0;
        int n = dist.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i)
            s += ceil((double)dist[i] / speed);
        
        // mind this: this last train 
        return s + (double)dist.back() / speed;
    }
    
public:
    int minSpeedOnTime(vector<int>& dist, double hour) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = 1e9;
        int m = 0;
        double t = 0;
        
        while (l < r)
        {
            m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            t = totalTime(dist, m);
            
            if (t > hour)
                l = m + 1;
            else
                r = m;
        }
        
        // mind this: might nerver arrive in time
        return r == 1e9 ? -1 : r;
    }
};
```
