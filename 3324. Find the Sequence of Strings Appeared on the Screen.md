# Easy

You are given a string $target$.

Alice is going to type $target$ on her computer using a special keyboard that has only two keys:

- Key 1 appends the character "a" to the string on the screen.
- Key 2 changes the last character of the string on the screen to its next character in the English alphabet.

Note that initially there is an empty string "" on the screen, so she can only press key 1.

Return a list of all strings that appear on the screen as Alice types $target$, in the order they appear, using the minimum key presses.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> stringSequence(string target) {
        vector<string> ans;
        string s = "a";

        for (char c : target)
        {
            while (s.back() < c)
            {
                ans.push_back(s);
                s.back() += 1;
            }

            ans.push_back(s);
            s.push_back('a');
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
