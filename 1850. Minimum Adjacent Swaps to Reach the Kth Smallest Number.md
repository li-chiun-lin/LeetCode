# Medium

You are given a string $num$, representing a large integer, and an integer $k$.

We call some integer wonderful if it is a permutation of the digits in $num$ and is greater in value than $num$. There can be many wonderful integers. However, we only care about the smallest-valued ones.

Return the minimum number of adjacent digit swaps that needs to be applied to $num$ to reach the $k$-th smallest wonderful integer.

The tests are generated in such a way that $k$-th smallest wonderful integer exists.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMinSwaps(string num, int k) {
        int n = size(num);
        string target = num;

        while (k --)
            next_permutation(begin(target), end(target));

        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int j = i;

            while (num[j] != target[i])
                ++ j;

            while (i < j)
            {
                swap(num[j], num[j - 1]);
                -- j;
                ++ ans;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
