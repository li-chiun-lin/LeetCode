# Medium

You are given two integers $m$ and $n$, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.

You are also given the $head$ of a linked list of integers.

Generate an $m \times n$ matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in spiral order (clockwise), starting from the top-left of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with $-1$.

Return the generated matrix.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> spiralMatrix(int m, int n, ListNode* head) {
        vector<vector<int>> mat(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
        
        int di[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
        int dj[] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
        int d = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        
        while (head)
        {
            mat[i][j] = head->val;
            head = head->next;
            
            if (! head)
                break;
            
            int ii = i + di[d];
            int jj = j + dj[d];
            
            while (ii < 0 || m <= ii|| jj < 0 || n <= jj || mat[ii][jj] != -1)
            {
                d = (d + 1) % 4;
                ii = i + di[d];
                jj = j + dj[d];
            }
            
            i = ii;
            j = jj;
        }
        
        return mat;
    }
};
