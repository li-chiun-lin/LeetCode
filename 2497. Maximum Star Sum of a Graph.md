There is an undirected graph consisting of $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given a 0-indexed integer array $vals$ of length $n$ where $vals[i]$ denotes the value of the $i$-th node.

You are also given a 2D integer array $edges$ where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$.

A star graph is a subgraph of the given graph having a center node containing $0$ or more neighbors. In other words, it is a subset of edges of the given graph such that there exists a common node for all edges.

The star sum is the sum of the values of all the nodes present in the star graph.

Given an integer $k$, return the maximum star sum of a star graph containing at most $k$ edges.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxStarSum(vector<int>& vals, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int k) {
        int n = vals.size();
        vector<priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<>>> star(n);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            // undirectional
            for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i)
            {
                auto& pq = star[e[i]];
                pq.push(vals[e[1 - i]]);
            
                // 1. we want at most k neighbors
                // 2. we don't want any neighbors with negative value
                while (pq.size() > k || (pq.size() && pq.top() < 0))
                    pq.pop();
            }
        }
        
        int ret = INT_MIN;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            auto& pq = star[i];
            // the star sum of center node
            int s = vals[i];
            
            // the star sum of neighbors.
            while (pq.size())
            {
                s += pq.top();
                pq.pop();
            }
            
            ret = max(ret, s);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
