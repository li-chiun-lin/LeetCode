# Medium

You are given an integer array *matches* where *matches[i] = [winner<sub>i</sub>, loser<sub>i</sub>]* indicates that the player *winner<sub>i</sub>* defeated player *loser<sub>i</sub>* in a match.

Return a list *answer* of size 2 where:

- *answer[0]* is a list of all players that have **not** lost any matches.
- *answer[1]* is a list of all players that have lost exactly **one** match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in **increasing** order.

Note:

- You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
- The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findWinners(vector<vector<int>>& matches) {
        map<int, int> lose;
        vector<vector<int>> ret(2);
        
        for (auto &m : matches)
        {
            // mark the existence of winner
            if (lose.find(m[0]) == lose.end())
                lose[m[0]] = 0;
            
            ++lose[m[1]];
        }
        
        for (auto &p : lose)
            if (p.second <= 1)
                ret[p.second].push_back(p.first);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
