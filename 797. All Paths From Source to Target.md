Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$, find all possible paths from node $0$ to node $n - 1$ and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: $graph[i]$ is a list of all nodes you can visit from node $i$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int from, int target, 
            vector<int> &path, vector<vector<int>> &ret)
    {
        path.push_back(from);
        
        if (from == target)
            ret.push_back(path);
        else
        {
            for (int u : graph[from])
                dfs(graph, u, target, path, ret);
        }
        
        path.pop_back();
    }
    vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        vector<int> path;
        
        dfs(graph, 0, graph.size() - 1, path, ret);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
