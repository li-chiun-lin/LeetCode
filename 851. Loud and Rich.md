# Medium

There is a group of $n$ people labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$ where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.

You are given an array $richer$ where $richer[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that $a_i$ has more money than $b_i$ and an integer array $quiet$ where $quiet[i]$ is the quietness of the $i$-th person. All the given data in $richer$ are logically correct.

Return an integer array $answer$ where $answer[x] = y$ if $y$ is the least quiet person (that is, the person $y$ with the smallest value of $quiet[y]$) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person $x$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(vector<int>& quiet, vector<vector<int>>& adj, int u, vector<int>& dp)
    {
        if (dp[u] != -1)
            return dp[u];
        
        // by default, `u' him/herself is the quieset person
        int qp = u;
        
        // check all other person richer than `u'
        for (int v : adj[u])
        {
            int qv = dfs(quiet, adj, v, dp);
            
            // update the quietest person.
            if (quiet[qp] > quiet[qv])
                qp = qv;
        }
        
        return dp[u] = qp;
    }
    
public:
    vector<int> loudAndRich(vector<vector<int>>& richer, vector<int>& quiet) {
        int n = quiet.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        vector<int> ret(n);
        
        // build the adjacent list base on richness
        for (auto& r : richer)
            adj[r[1]].push_back(r[0]);
        
        vector<int> dp(n, -1);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ret[i] = dfs(quiet, adj, i, dp);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
