# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $tires$ where $tires[i] = [f_i, r_i]$ indicates that the $i$-th tire can finish its $x$-th successive lap in $f_i * r_i^{x-1}$ seconds.

You are also given an integer $changeTime$ and an integer $numLaps$.

The race consists of $numLaps$ laps and you may start the race with any tire. You have an unlimited supply of each tire and after every lap, you may change to any given tire (including the current tire type) if you wait $changeTime$ seconds.

Return the minimum time to finish the race.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumFinishTime(vector<vector<int>>& tires, int changeTime, int numLaps) {
        int n = size(tires);
        int mx = 2e9;
        vector<vector<int>> ub(n, vector<int>(20, mx));
        vector<int> dp(numLaps + 1, mx);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            ub[i][1] = tires[i][0];

            for (int j = 2; j < 20 && (long long)ub[i][j - 1] * tires[i][1] < mx; ++j)
                ub[i][j] = (long long)ub[i][j - 1] * tires[i][1];

            for (int j = 2; j < 20 && (long long)ub[i][j - 1] + ub[i][j] < mx; ++j)
                ub[i][j] += ub[i][j - 1];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            dp[1] = min(dp[1], tires[i][0]);

        for (int x = 1; x <= numLaps; ++x)
        {
            if (x < 20)
                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
                    dp[x] = min(dp[x], ub[i][x]);

            for (int j = x - 1; j > 0&& x - j <= 18; --j)
                dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[j] + changeTime + dp[x - j]);
        }

        return dp.back();
    }
};
