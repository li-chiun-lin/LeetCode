You are given two integer arrays $nums1$ and $nums2$ of equal length $n$ and an integer $k$. You can perform the following operation on $nums1$:

- Choose two indexes $i$ and $j$ and increment $nums1[i]$ by $k$ and decrement $nums1[j]$ by $k$. In other words, $nums1[i] = nums1[i] + k$ and $nums1[j] = nums1[j] - k$.

$nums1$ is said to be equal to $nums2$ if for all indices $i$ such that $0 \leq i < n, nums1[i] == nums2[i]$.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make $nums1$ equal to $nums2$. If it is impossible to make them equal, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minOperations(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
        int n = nums1.size();
        long long pos = 0, neg = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            long long diff = nums1[i] - nums2[i];

            if (diff == 0)
                continue;

            if (k == 0 || diff % k)
                return -1;

            if (diff > 0)
                pos += diff / k;
            else
                neg += diff / k;
        }

        if (pos + neg != 0)
            return -1;

        return pos;
    }
};
```
