# Hard

You are given an integer array $nums$. In one operation, you can replace any element in $nums$ with any integer.

$nums$ is considered continuous if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:

- All elements in nums are unique.
- The difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in nums equals $nums.length - 1$.

Return the minimum number of operations to make $nums$ continuous.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = size(nums);
        int ans = n;

        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));
        nums.erase(unique(begin(nums), end(nums)), end(nums));
        int m = size(nums);

        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < m; ++i)
        {
            while (j < m && nums[j] < nums[i] + n)
                ++ j;

            ans = min(ans, n - (j - i));
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
