# Easy

There are $n$ employees in a company, numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. Each employee $i$ has worked for $hours[i]$ hours in the company.

The company requires each employee to work for at least target hours.

You are given a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers $hours$ of length $n$ and a non-negative integer $target$.

Return the integer denoting the number of employees who worked at least $target$ hours.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(vector<int>& hours, int target) {
        int cnt = 0;

        for (auto h : hours)
            cnt += h >= target;

        return cnt;
    }
};
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(vector<int>& hours, int target) {
        sort(begin(hours), end(hours));
        int id = lower_bound(begin(hours), end(hours), target) - begin(hours);
        return size(hours) - id;
    }
};
```
