You are given two integer arrays $nums1$ of length $n$ and $nums2$ of length $n + 1$.

You want to transform $nums1$ into $nums2$ using the minimum number of operations.

You may perform the following operations any number of times, each time choosing an index $i$:

- Increase $nums1[i]$ by $1$.
- Decrease $nums1[i]$ by $1$.
- Append $nums1[i]$ to the end of the array.

Return the minimum number of operations required to transform $nums1$ into $nums2$.
