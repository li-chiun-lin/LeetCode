# Medium

You are given an $m \times n$ binary matrix $grid$.

A row or column is considered palindromic if its values read the same forward and backward.

You can flip any number of cells in $grid$ from $0$ to $1$, or from $1$ to $0$.

Return the minimum number of cells that need to be flipped to make either all rows palindromic or all columns palindromic.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = size(grid);
        int n = size(grid[0]);
        int h = 0;
        int v = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            for (int l = 0, r = n - 1; l < r; ++l, --r)
                if (grid[i][l] != grid[i][r])
                    ++ v;

        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            for (int t = 0, b = m - 1; t < b; ++t, --b)
                if (grid[t][j] != grid[b][j])
                    ++ h;

        return min(v, h);
    }
};
```
