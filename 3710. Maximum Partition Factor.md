# Hard

You are given a 2D integer array $points$, where $points[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ represents the coordinates of the $i$-th point on the Cartesian plane.

The Manhattan distance between two points $points[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ and $points[j] = [x_j, y_j]$ is $|x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|$.

Split the $n$ points into exactly two non-empty groups. The partition factor of a split is the minimum Manhattan distance among all unordered pairs of points that lie in the same group.

Return the maximum possible partition factor over all valid splits.

Note: A group of size 1 contributes no intra-group pairs. When $n = 2$ (both groups size 1), there are no intra-group pairs, so define the partition factor as $0$.
