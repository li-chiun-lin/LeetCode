There is an **n x n** 0-indexed grid with some artifacts buried in it. You are given the integer **n** and a 0-indexed 2D integer array **artifacts** describing the positions of the rectangular artifacts where **artifacts[i] = [r1<sub>i</sub>, c1<sub>i</sub>, r2<sub>i</sub>, c2<sub>i</sub>]** denotes that the **i**-th artifact is buried in the subgrid where:

- **(r1<sub>i</sub>, c1<sub>i</sub>)** is the coordinate of the top-left cell of the **i**-th artifact and
- **(r2<sub>i</sub>, c2<sub>i</sub>)** is the coordinate of the bottom-right cell of the **i**-th artifact.

You will excavate some cells of the grid and remove all the mud from them. If the cell has a part of an artifact buried underneath, it will be uncovered. If all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, you can extract it.

Given a 0-indexed 2D integer array **dig** where **dig[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]** indicates that you will excavate the cell **(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)**, return the number of artifacts that you can extract.

The test cases are generated such that:

- No two artifacts overlap.
- Each artifact only covers at most **4** cells.
- The entries of **dig** are unique.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int digArtifacts(int n, vector<vector<int>>& artifacts, vector<vector<int>>& dig) {
        vector<vector<int>> grid(n, vector<int>(n));
        int c = 0;
        
        for (auto &d : dig)
            grid[d[0]][d[1]] = 1;
        
        for (auto &a : artifacts)
        {
            int flag = 1;
            for (int i = a[0]; i <= a[2]; ++i)
                for (int j = a[1]; j <= a[3]; ++j)
                    flag &= grid[i][j];
            
            c += flag;
        }
        
        return c;
    }
};
```
