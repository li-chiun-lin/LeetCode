You are given an integer array $nums$ where the $i$-th bag contains $nums[i]$ balls. You are also given an integer $maxOperations$.

You can perform the following operation at most $maxOperations$ times:

- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.

Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int maxOperations) {
        int l = 1;
        int r = 1e9;

        while (l < r)
        {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            int c = 0;

            for (int x : nums)
                c += (x - 1) / m;

            if (c > maxOperations)
                l = m + 1;
            else
                r = m;
        }

        return r;
    }
};
```
