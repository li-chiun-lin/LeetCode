# Medium

You are given an integer array $nums$ where the $i$-th bag contains $nums[i]$ balls. You are also given an integer $maxOperations$.

You can perform the following operation at most $maxOperations$ times:

- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.

Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int maxOperations) {
        int left = 1, right = 1e9;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Count required operations to make all balls <= mid
            int operations = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                operations += (num - 1) / mid;
            }

            // Adjust search range based on operation count
            if (operations > maxOperations) {
                left = mid + 1;  // Increase size limit
            } else {
                right = mid;  // Decrease size limit
            }
        }

        return left;  // Minimum size that works
    }
};
