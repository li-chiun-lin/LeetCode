# Medium

You have observations of **n + m** 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered **from 1 to 6**. **n** of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of **m** rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the **n + m** rolls.

You are given an integer array rolls of length **m** where **rolls[i]** is the value of the **i**-th observation. You are also given the two integers **mean** and **n**.

Return an array of length **n** containing the missing observations such that the average value of the **n + m** rolls is exactly **mean**. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

The average value of a set of **k** numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by **k**.

Note that **mean** is an integer, so the sum of the **n + m** rolls should be divisible by **n + m**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> missingRolls(vector<int>& rolls, int mean, int n) {
        int m = rolls.size();
        int sum_m = accumulate(rolls.begin(), rolls.end(), 0);
        int sum = mean * (n + m);
        int sum_n = sum - sum_m;
        
        if (sum_n > n * 6 || sum_n < n)
            return {};
        
        vector<int> ret(n);
        
        int idx = 0;
        while (sum_n --)
        {
            if (++ ret[idx] > 6)
                return {};
            
            ++ idx;
            idx %= n;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
