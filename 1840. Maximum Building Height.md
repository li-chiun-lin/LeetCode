# Hard

You want to build $n$ new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from $1$ to $n$.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

- The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
- The height of the first building must be $0$.
- The height difference between any two adjacent buildings cannot exceed $1$.

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array $restrictions$ where $restrictions[i] = [id_i, maxHeight_i]$ indicates that building $id_i$ must have a height less than or equal to $maxHeight_i$.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear at most once in $restrictions$, and building $1$ will not be in $restrictions$.

Return the maximum possible height of the tallest building.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxBuilding(int n, vector<vector<int>>& restrictions) {
        restrictions.push_back({1, 0});
        restrictions.push_back({n, n - 1});

        sort(begin(restrictions), end(restrictions));

        for (int i = 0; i + 1 < size(restrictions); ++i)
        {
            auto& h1 = restrictions[i][1];
            auto& h2 = restrictions[i + 1][1];
            auto w = h1 + abs(restrictions[i][0] - restrictions[i + 1][0]);

            if (w > h2)
                w = h2 + (w - h2) / 2;

            h2 = min(h2, w); 
        }

        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = size(restrictions) - 1; i - 1 >= 0; --i)
        {
            auto& h1 = restrictions[i][1];
            auto& h2 = restrictions[i - 1][1];
            auto w = h1 + abs(restrictions[i][0] - restrictions[i - 1][0]);

            if (w > h2)
                w = h2 + (w - h2) / 2;

            h2 = min(h2, w); 
            ans = max(ans, w);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
