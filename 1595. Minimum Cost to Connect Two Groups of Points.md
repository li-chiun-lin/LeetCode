# Hard

You are given two groups of points where the first group has $size_1$ points, the second group has $size_2$ points, and $size_1 \geq size_2$.

The $cost$ of the connection between any two points are given in an $size_1 \times size_2$ matrix where $cost[i][j]$ is the cost of connecting point $i$ of the first group and point $j$ of the second group. The groups are connected if each point in both groups is connected to one or more points in the opposite group. In other words, each point in the first group must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each point in the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.

Return the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int connectTwoGroups(vector<vector<int>>& cost) {
        int m = size(cost);
        int n = size(cost[0]);
        vector<vector<int>> dp(13, vector<int>(1 << 12));
        vector<int> min_cost2(n, INT_MAX);

        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
                min_cost2[j] = min(min_cost2[j], cost[i][j]);

        function<int(int, int)> dfs = [&](int i, int mask) -> int
        {
            if (dp[i][mask])
                return dp[i][mask] - 1;

            int ans = 0;

            if (i >= m)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                    if ((mask & (1 << j)) == 0)
                        ans += min_cost2[j];
            }
            else
            {
                ans = INT_MAX;

                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                    ans = min(ans, cost[i][j] + dfs(i + 1, mask | (1 << j)));
            }

            dp[i][mask] = ans + 1;
            return ans;
        };
        
        return dfs(0, 0);
    }
};
