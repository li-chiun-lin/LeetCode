# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $questions$ where $questions[i] = [points_i, brainpower_i]$.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question $0$) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question. Solving question $i$ will earn you $points_i$ points but you will be unable to solve each of the next $brainpower_i$ questions. If you skip question $i$, you get to make the decision on the next question.

Return the $maximum$ points you can earn for the exam.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    // Helper function to perform depth-first search with memoization
    long long dfs(vector<vector<int>>& questions, int index, vector<long long> &dp)
    {
        // Base case: If the index is out of bounds, return 0 (no points can be earned)
        if (index >= questions.size())
            return 0;
        
        // If already computed, return stored result
        if (dp[index])
            return dp[index];
        
        // Option 1: Solve the current question and skip (questions[index][1]) questions ahead
        long long takeCurrent = dfs(questions, index + questions[index][1] + 1, dp) + questions[index][0];
        
        // Option 2: Skip the current question and move to the next one
        long long skipCurrent = dfs(questions, index + 1, dp);
        
        // Store the maximum of both choices in dp array
        return dp[index] = max(takeCurrent, skipCurrent);
    }
    
    // Function to find the maximum points that can be earned
    long long mostPoints(vector<vector<int>>& questions) 
    {
        vector<long long> dp(questions.size()); // Memoization table
        return dfs(questions, 0, dp); // Start DFS from index 0
    }
};
```
