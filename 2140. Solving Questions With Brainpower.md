# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array **questions** where **questions[i] = [points<sub>i</sub>, brainpower<sub>i</sub>]**.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question **0**) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question. Solving question **i** will earn you **points<sub>i</sub>** points but you will be unable to solve each of the next **brainpower<sub>i</sub>** questions. If you skip question **i**, you get to make the decision on the next question.

- For example, given questions = **[[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]**:
  - If question **0** is solved, you will earn **3** points but you will be unable to solve questions **1** and **2**.
  - If instead, question **0** is skipped and question **1** is solved, you will earn **4** points but you will be unable to solve questions **2** and **3**.

Return the **maximum** points you can earn for the exam.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long dfs(vector<vector<int>>& q, int i, vector<long long> &dp)
    {
        if (i >= q.size())
            return 0;
        
        if (dp[i])
            return dp[i];
        
        long long r1 = dfs(q, i + q[i][1] + 1, dp) + q[i][0];
        long long r2 = dfs(q, i + 1, dp);
        
        return dp[i] = max(r1, r2);
    }
    
    long long mostPoints(vector<vector<int>>& questions) {
        vector<long long> dp(questions.size());
        return dfs(questions, 0, dp);
    }
};
```
