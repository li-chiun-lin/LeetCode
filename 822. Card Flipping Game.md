You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays $fronts$ and $backs$ of length $n$, where the $i$-th card has the positive integer $fronts[i]$ printed on the front and $backs[i]$ printed on the back. Initially, each card is placed on a table such that the front number is facing up and the other is facing down. You may flip over any number of cards (possibly zero).

After flipping the cards, an integer is considered good if it is facing down on some card and not facing up on any card.

Return the minimum possible good integer after flipping the cards. If there are no good integers, return $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int flipgame(vector<int>& fronts, vector<int>& backs) {
        int n = size(fronts);
        set<int> never, candidate;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (fronts[i] == backs[i])
                never.insert(fronts[i]);
            else
            {
                candidate.insert(fronts[i]);
                candidate.insert(backs[i]);
            }

        for (auto& k : candidate)
        {
            if (never.count(k))
                continue;

            return k;
        }

        return 0;
    }
};
