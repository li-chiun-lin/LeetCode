# Medium

You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a circle with the center as the location of the bomb.

The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array **bombs** where **bombs[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]**. **x<sub>i</sub>** and **y<sub>i</sub>** denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the **i**-th bomb, whereas **r<sub>i</sub>** denotes the radius of its range.

You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.

Given the list of **bombs**, return the **maximum** number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumDetonation(vector<vector<int>>& bombs) {
        int n = bombs.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j)
            {
                int d = pow(bombs[i][0] - bombs[j][0], 2) + pow(bombs[i][1] - bombs[j][1], 2);
                if (d <= pow(bombs[i][2], 2))
                    adj[i].push_back(j);
                
                if (d <= pow(bombs[j][2], 2))
                    adj[j].push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        int m = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            vector<bool> visited(n);
            int c = 1;
            
            queue<int> que;
            que.push(i);
            
            while (que.size())
                int f = que.front();
