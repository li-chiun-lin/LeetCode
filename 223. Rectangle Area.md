Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner $(ax1, ay1)$ and its top-right corner $(ax2, ay2)$.

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner $(bx1, by1)$ and its top-right corner $(bx2, by2)$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int overlap(int a1, int a2, int b1, int b2)
    {
        return min(a2, b2) - max(a1, b1);
    }
    
    int computeArea(int ax1, int ay1, int ax2, int ay2, int bx1, int by1, int bx2, int by2) {
        int dif_x = max(overlap(ax1, ax2, bx1, bx2), 0);
        int dif_y = max(overlap(ay1, ay2, by1, by2), 0);
        int dif_a = dif_x * dif_y;
        
        return (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1) + (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1) - 
            dif_a;
    }
};
```
