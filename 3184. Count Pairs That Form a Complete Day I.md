# Easy

Given an integer array $hours$ representing times in hours, return an integer denoting the number of pairs $i$, $j$ where $i < j$ and $hours[i] + hours[j]$ forms a complete day.

A complete day is defined as a time duration that is an exact multiple of 24 hours.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countCompleteDayPairs(vector<int>& hours) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = size(hours);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j)
                if ((hours[i] + hours[j]) % 24 == 0)
                    ++ ans;
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
