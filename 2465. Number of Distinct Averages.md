# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ of even length.

As long as $nums$ is not empty, you must repetitively:

- Find the minimum number in $nums$ and remove it.
- Find the maximum number in $nums$ and remove it.
- Calculate the average of the two removed numbers.

The average of two numbers $a$ and $b$ is $(a + b) / 2$.

Return the number of distinct averages calculated using the above process.

Note that when there is a tie for a minimum or maximum number, any can be removed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distinctAverages(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        set<double> avg;
        
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));
        
        for (int i = 0, j = n - 1; i < j; ++i, --j)
            avg.insert((nums[i] + nums[j]) / 2.0);
        
        return avg.size();
    }
};
```
