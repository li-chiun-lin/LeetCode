# Medium

You are given an array **nums** of positive integers. In one operation, you can choose any number from **nums** and reduce it to exactly half the number. (Note that you may choose this reduced number in future operations.)

Return the **minimum** number of operations to reduce the sum of **nums** by at least half.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int halveArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        priority_queue<double> pq;
        double sum = 0;
        
        for (int x : nums)
        {
            pq.push(x);
            sum += x;
        }
        
        double xx = 0;
        int c = 0;
        
        while (xx * 2 < sum)
        {
            double t = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            t /= 2;
            xx += t;
            pq.push(t);
            ++ c;
        }
        
        return c;
    }
};
```
