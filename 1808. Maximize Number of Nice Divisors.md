# Hard

You are given a positive integer $primeFactors$. You are asked to construct a positive integer $n$ that satisfies the following conditions:

- The number of prime factors of $n$ (not necessarily distinct) is at most $primeFactors$.
- The number of nice divisors of $n$ is maximized. Note that a divisor of $n$ is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of $n$.

Return the number of nice divisors of $n$. Since that number can be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNiceDivisors(int primeFactors) {
        
        if (primeFactors <= 3)
            return primeFactors;

        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        long long d = primeFactors / 3;
        long long r = primeFactors % 3;

        if (r == 1)
        {
            r += 3;
            -- d;
        }
        else if (r == 0)
            ++ r;

        long long a = 3;

        while (d)
        {
            if (d & 1)
                r = r * a % m;

            a = a * a % m;
            d >>= 1;
        }

        return r;
    }
};
```
