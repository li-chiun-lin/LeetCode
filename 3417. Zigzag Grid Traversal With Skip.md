# Easy

You are given an $m \times n$ 2D array $grid$ of positive integers.

Your task is to traverse $grid$ in a zigzag pattern while skipping every alternate cell.

Zigzag pattern traversal is defined as following the below actions:

- Start at the top-left cell $(0, 0)$.
- Move right within a row until the end of the row is reached.
- Drop down to the next row, then traverse left until the beginning of the row is reached.
- Continue alternating between right and left traversal until every row has been traversed.

Note that you must skip every alternate cell during the traversal.

Return an array of integers $result$ containing, in order, the value of the cells visited during the zigzag traversal with skips.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> zigzagTraversal(vector<vector<int>>& grid) 
    {
        vector<int> result; // Stores the zigzag traversal result
        int rows = grid.size(); // Number of rows in the grid
        int cols = grid[0].size(); // Number of columns in the grid

        // Traverse each row of the grid
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) 
        {
            if (i % 2 == 0) 
            {
                // Even-indexed rows: left to right traversal
                for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) 
                {
                    if ((i + j) % 2 == 0)
                    {
                        result.push_back(grid[i][j]);
                    }
                }
            } 
            else 
            {
                // Odd-indexed rows: right to left traversal
                for (int j = cols - 1; j >= 0; --j) 
                {
                    if ((i + j) % 2 == 0) 
                    {
                        result.push_back(grid[i][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return result; // Return the final zigzag traversal
    }
};
```
