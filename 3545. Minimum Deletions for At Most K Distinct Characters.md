# Easy

You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer $k$.

Your task is to delete some (possibly none) of the characters in the string so that the number of distinct characters in the resulting string is at most $k$.

Return the minimum number of deletions required to achieve this.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, keep only `k` most frequent characters.
     * Return the minimum number of deletions needed to remove all other characters.
     */
    int minDeletion(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);  // Frequency of each lowercase character

        // Count frequency of each character in the string
        for (char c : s) {
            ++freq[c - 'a'];
        }

        // Sort frequencies in ascending order
        sort(freq.begin(), freq.end());

        int deletions = 0;
        int i = 25;  // Start from most frequent character

        // Skip the top `k` non-zero frequencies
        while (i >= 0 && freq[i] > 0 && k > 0) {
            --k;
            --i;
        }

        // Sum the rest of the frequencies for deletion
        while (i >= 0 && freq[i] > 0) {
            deletions += freq[i];
            --i;
        }

        return deletions;
    }
};
```
