You are given an integer $n$ denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$.

You are also given a 2D integer array $roads$ where $roads[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities $a_i$ and $b_i$.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from $1$ to $n$, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        vector<long long> deg(n);
        
        for (auto &r : roads)
        {
            ++deg[r[0]];
            ++deg[r[1]];
        }
        
        sort(begin(deg), end(deg));
        
        long long sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            sum += deg[i] * (i + 1);
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
