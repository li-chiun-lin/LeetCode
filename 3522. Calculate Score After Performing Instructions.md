# Medium

You are given two arrays, $instructions$ and $values$, both of size $n$.

You need to simulate a process based on the following rules:

- You start at the first instruction at index $i = 0$ with an initial score of $0$.
- If $instructions[i]$ is "add":
  - Add $values[i]$ to your score.
  - Move to the next instruction $(i + 1)$.
- If $instructions[i]$ is "jump":
  - Move to the instruction at index $(i + values[i])$ without modifying your score.

The process ends when you either:

- Go out of bounds (i.e., $i < 0$ or $i >= n$), or
- Attempt to revisit an instruction that has been previously executed. The revisited instruction is not executed.

Return your score at the end of the process.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Calculates the score by simulating instruction execution.
    long long calculateScore(vector<string>& instructions, vector<int>& values) {
        int index = 0;
        int n = values.size();
        long long score = 0;

        // Track visited instructions to prevent infinite loops
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);

        // Simulate the instruction execution
        while (index >= 0 && index < n && !visited[index]) {
            visited[index] = true;

            if (instructions[index][0] == 'a') {
                // "add" instruction: accumulate score and move to next instruction
                score += values[index];
                ++index;
            } else {
                // "jump" instruction: move to the target instruction based on value
                index += values[index];
            }
        }

        return score;
    }
};
```
