# Hard

There is a directed graph consisting of $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$ and $n$ directed edges.

You are given a 0-indexed array $edges$ where $edges[i]$ indicates that there is an edge from node $i$ to node $edges[i]$.

Consider the following process on the graph:

- You start from a node $x$ and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this same process.

Return an array $answer$ where $answer[i]$ is the number of different nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node $i$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countVisitedNodes(vector<int>& edges) {
        int n = size(edges);
        vector<int> answer(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++ i)
        {
            int j = i;
            set<int> visited;
            vector<int> sta;

            while (visited.count(j) == 0 && answer[j] == 0)
            {
                visited.insert(j);
                sta.push_back(j);
                j = edges[j];
            }

            if (visited.count(j))
            {
                int k = distance(find(begin(sta), end(sta), j), end(sta));

                for (int l = 0; l < k; ++l)
                {
                    answer[sta.back()] = k;
                    sta.pop_back();
                }
            }

            while (size(sta))
            {
                j = sta.back();
                sta.pop_back();
                answer[j] = answer[edges[j]] + 1;
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
```
