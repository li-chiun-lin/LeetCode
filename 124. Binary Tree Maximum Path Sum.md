A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the $root$ of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rec(TreeNode *root, int &m)
    {
        if (! root)
            return 0;
        
        int l = max(rec(root->left, m), 0);
        int r = max(rec(root->right, m), 0);
        
        m = max(m, root->val + r + l);
        
        return max(l, r) + root->val;
    }
    
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int m = INT_MIN;
        rec(root, m);
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
