Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling. For example:

In these strings like "heeellooo", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: "h", "eee", "ll", "ooo".

You are given a string $s$ and an array of query strings $words$. A query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to $s$ by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters $c$, and add some number of characters $c$ to the group so that the size of the group is three or more.

Return the number of query strings that are stretchy.

```cpp
class Solution {
    vector<pair<char, int>> run_length(string& s)
    {
        vector<pair<char, int>> rl;
        
        int len = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); ++i)
        {
            // same char, increase counter.
            if (s[i - 1] == s[i])
                ++ len;
            // different char, record and reset the counter
            else
            {
                rl.push_back({s[i - 1], len});
                len = 1;
            }
        }
        
        // the last group
        rl.push_back({s.back(), len});
        
        return rl;
    }

                    // `w' must have exactly the same number of char
                    if (rl_s[i].second < 3)

                    // `w' can extend to the same size only if `w' has fewer or equal number of char
                    else

                        if (rl_w[i].second > rl_s[i].second)
