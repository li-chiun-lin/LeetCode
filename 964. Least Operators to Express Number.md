# Hard

Given a single positive integer $x$, we will write an expression of the form $x\ (op1)\ x\ (op2)\ x\ (op3)\ x\ ...$ where each operator $op1, op2,$ etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (+, -, *, or /).

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:

- The division operator (/) returns rational numbers.
- There are no parentheses placed anywhere.
- We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
- It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-).

We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given $target$. Return the least number of operators used.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leastOpsExpressTarget(int x, int target) {
        if (x > target)
            return min(target * 2 - 1, (x - target) * 2);
        else if (x == target)
            return 0;

        long long sum = x;
        int cnt = 0;

        while (sum < target)
        {
            sum *= x;
            ++ cnt;
        }

        if (sum == target)
            return cnt;

        int l = INT_MAX;

        if (sum - target < target)
            l = leastOpsExpressTarget(x, sum - target) + cnt;

        int r = leastOpsExpressTarget(x, target - (sum / x)) + cnt - 1;

        return min(l, r) + 1;
    }
};
```
