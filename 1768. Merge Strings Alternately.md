# Easy

You are given two strings **word1** and **word2**. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with **word1**. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string ret = "";
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        
        while (i < word1.size() && j < word2.size())
            ret += {word1[i ++], word2[j ++]};
        
        while (i < word1.size())
            ret += word1[i ++];
        
        while (j < word2.size())
            ret += word2[j ++];
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
