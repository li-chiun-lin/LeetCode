# Hard

Alice is a caretaker of $n$ gardens and she wants to plant flowers to maximize the total beauty of all her gardens.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $flowers$ of size $n$, where $flowers[i]$ is the number of flowers already planted in the $i$-th garden. Flowers that are already planted cannot be removed. You are then given another integer $newFlowers$, which is the maximum number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers $target$, $full$, and $partial$.

A garden is considered complete if it has at least $target$ flowers. The total beauty of the gardens is then determined as the sum of the following:

- The number of complete gardens multiplied by $full$.
- The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by $partial$. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be $0$.

Return the maximum total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most $newFlowers$ flowers.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumBeauty(vector<int>& flowers, long long newFlowers, int target, int full, int partial) {
        sort(begin(flowers), end(flowers), greater<int>());
        long long p1 = 0;
        long long sum = 0;
        long long ans = 0;
        long long n = size(flowers);

        while (p1 < n && target - flowers[p1] <= newFlowers)
            newFlowers -= max(0, target - flowers[p1 ++]);

        if (p1 == n)
            return max(n * full, (n - 1) * full + 
                (flowers.back() < target
                    ? (long long)(target - 1) * partial
                    : full));

        long long mi = flowers.back();
        long long p2 = n - 1;

        while (mi < target)
        {
            while (p2 >= p1 && flowers[p2] <= mi)
                sum += flowers[p2 --];

            int cnt = (n - p2 - 1) * mi - sum;

            if (cnt > newFlowers)
            {
                if (-- p1 < 0)
                    break;

                newFlowers += max(0, target - flowers[p1]);
            }
            else
            {
                ans = max(ans, p1 * full + mi * partial);
                ++ mi;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
