# Medium

Given two numbers, $hour$ and $minutes$, return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the $hour$ and the $minute$ hand.

Answers within $10^{-5}$ of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        double deg_hour = hour * 30 + minutes * 0.5;
        double deg_minu = minutes * 6;
        double diff = abs(deg_hour - deg_minu);
        
        return diff <= 180 ? diff : 360 - diff;
    }
};
```
