You are given the $root$ of a binary tree containing digits from $0$ to $9$ only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rec(TreeNode *root, int acc)
    {
        if (! root)
            return 0;
        
        acc *= 10;
        acc += root->val;
        
        if (! root->left && ! root->right)
            return acc;
        
        return rec(root->left, acc) + rec(root->right, acc);
    }
    
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        return rec(root, 0);
    }
};
```
