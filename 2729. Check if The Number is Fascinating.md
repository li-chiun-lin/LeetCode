# Easy

You are given an integer $n$ that consists of exactly 3 digits.

We call the number $n$ fascinating if, after the following modification, the resulting number contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once and does not contain any 0's:

- Concatenate $n$ with the numbers $2 \times n$ and $3 \times n$.

Return $true$ if $n$ is fascinating, or $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isFascinating(int n) {
        int bit = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; ++i)
            for (int x = n * i; x ; x /= 10)
            {
                if (bit & (1 << (x % 10)))
                    return false;
                
                bit |= 1 << (x % 10);
            }
        
        return bit == (1 << 10) - 2;
    }
};
```
