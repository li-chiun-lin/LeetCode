A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. For example, **"Hello World", "HELLO", "hello world hello world"** are all sentences. Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Two sentences **sentence1** and **sentence2** are similar if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence (possibly empty) inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal.

Given two sentences **sentence1** and **sentence2**, return **true** if **sentence1** and **sentence2** are similar. Otherwise, return **false**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool areSentencesSimilar(string s1, string s2) {
        // make sure s2 is longer than s1
        if (s1.size() > s2.size())
            swap(s1, s2);
        
        // split s1 and s2 into tok1 and tok2 using stringstream.
        vector<string> tok1, tok2;
        string tok = "";
        stringstream ss1(s1), ss2(s2);
        
        while (ss1 >> tok)
            tok1.push_back(tok);
        
        while (ss2 >> tok)
            tok2.push_back(tok);

        int l = 0;
        int r1 = tok1.size() - 1;
        int r2 = tok2.size() - 1;
        
        // find the breaking point from the left
        while (l < tok1.size() && tok1[l] == tok2[l])
            ++ l;
        
        // find the breaking point from the right
        while (r1 >= 0 && tok1[r1] == tok2[r2])
        {
            -- r1;
            -- r2;
        }
        
        // check coincide
        return l > r1;
    }
};
```
