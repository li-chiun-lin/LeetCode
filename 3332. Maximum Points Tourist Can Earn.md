You are given two integers, $n$ and $k$, along with two 2D integer arrays, $stayScore$ and $travelScore$.

A tourist is visiting a country with $n$ cities, where each city is directly connected to every other city. The tourist's journey consists of exactly $k$ 0-indexed days, and they can choose any city as their starting point.

Each day, the tourist has two choices:

- Stay in the current city: If the tourist stays in their current city $curr$ during day $i$, they will earn $stayScore[i][curr]$ points.
- Move to another city: If the tourist moves from their current city $curr$ to city $dest$, they will earn $travelScore[curr][dest]$ points.

Return the maximum possible points the tourist can earn.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>>& stayScore, vector<vector<int>>& travelScore, int i, int curr, vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        if (i == k)
            return 0;

        if (dp[i][curr] != -1)
            return dp[i][curr];

        int stay = dfs(n, k, stayScore, travelScore, i + 1, curr, dp) + stayScore[i][curr];
        int travel = 0;

        for (int dest = 0; dest < n; ++dest)
            if (dest != curr)
                travel = max(travel, dfs(n, k, stayScore, travelScore, i + 1, dest, dp) + travelScore[curr][dest]);

        return dp[i][curr] = max(stay, travel);
    }

public:
    int maxScore(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>>& stayScore, vector<vector<int>>& travelScore) {
        int ans = 0;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k, vector<int>(n, -1));

        for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start)
            ans = max(ans, dfs(n, k, stayScore, travelScore, 0, start, dp));

        return ans;
    }
