# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed integer array **nums**, where **nums[i]** represents the score of the **i**-th student. You are also given an integer **k**.

Pick the scores of any **k** students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the **k** scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int k1 = k - 1;
 
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        int m = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = k1; i < nums.size(); ++i)
            m = min(m, nums[i] - nums[i - k1]);
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
