# Medium

You are given a string $s$, which contains stars __*__.

In one operation, you can:

- Choose a star in $s$.
- Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the string after all stars have been removed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        string t = "";
        
        for (char c : s)
        {
            if (c == '*')
                t.pop_back();
            else
                t.push_back(c);
        }
        
        return t;
    }
};
```
