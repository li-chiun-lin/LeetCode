# Hard

A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits $s$ and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range $[1, k]$ and there are no leading zeros in the array.

Given the string $s$ and the integer $k$, return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as $s$ using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArrays(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        
        dp[n] = 1;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            if (s[i] == '0')
                continue;

            for (long long j = i + 1, v = 0; j <= n; ++j)
            {
                v = v * 10 + s[j - 1] - '0';

                if (v > k)
                    break;

                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % m;
            }
        }

        return dp[0];
    }
};
```
