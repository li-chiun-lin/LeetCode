Given two strings $s$ and $t$, your goal is to convert $s$ into $t$ in $k$ moves or less.

During the $i$-th ($1 \leq i \leq k$) move you can:

- Choose any index $j$ (1-indexed) from $s$, such that $1 \leq j \leq s.length$ and $j$ has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index $i$ times.
- Do nothing.

Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that **'z'** becomes **'a'**). Shifting a character by $i$ means applying the shift operations $i$ times.

Remember that any index $j$ can be picked at most once.

Return $true$ if it's possible to convert $s$ into $t$ in no more than $k$ moves, otherwise return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConvertString(string s, string t, int k) {
        
        if (s.size() != t.size())
            return false;
        
        // count the quota of every possible shift 1 ~ 25 given by k wrapping around 26.
        int q = k / 26;
        int r = k % 26;
        
        vector<int> quota(26, q);
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= r; ++i)
            ++ quota[i];
        
        // compare each char
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
        {
            // find the difference
            int d = (t[i] - s[i] + 26) % 26;
            
            // skip when d == 0
            // if run out of quota of any d, sad, can not convert.
            if (d && -- quota[d] < 0)
                return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
