# Hard

You are given an integer $n$ and an undirected tree rooted at node $0$ with $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. This is represented by a 2D array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates an undirected edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$.

You are also given an integer array $nums$, where $nums[i]$ is the positive integer assigned to node $i$.

Define a value $t_i$ as the number of ancestors of node $i$ such that the product $nums[i] \times nums[ancestor]$ is a perfect square.

Return the sum of all $t_i$ values for all nodes $i$ in range $[1, n - 1]$.

Note: In a rooted tree, the ancestors of node $i$ are all nodes on the path from node $i$ to the root node $0$, excluding $i$ itself.
