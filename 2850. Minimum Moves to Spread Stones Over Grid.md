You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix $grid$ of size $3 \times 3$, representing the number of stones in each cell. The grid contains exactly 9 stones, and there can be multiple stones in a single cell.

In one move, you can move a single stone from its current cell to any other cell if the two cells share a side.

Return the minimum number of moves required to place one stone in each cell.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMoves(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int ret = INT_MAX;

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j)
                if (grid[i][j] == 0)
                {
                    for (int r = 0; r < 3; ++r)
                        for (int c = 0; c < 3; ++c)
                            if (grid[r][c] > 1)
                            {
                                int move = abs(r - i) + abs(c - j);

                                -- grid[r][c];
                                ++ grid[i][j];
                                ret = min(ret, move + minimumMoves(grid));
                                -- grid[i][j];
                                ++ grid[r][c];
                            }
                }

        return ret == INT_MAX ? 0 : ret;
    }
