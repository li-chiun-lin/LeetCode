# Medium

You are given an integer $num$. You will apply the following steps exactly two times:

- Pick a digit $x$ ($0 \leq x \leq 9$).
- Pick another digit $y$ ($0 \leq y \leq 9$). The digit $y$ can be equal to $x$.
- Replace all the occurrences of $x$ in the decimal representation of num by $y$.
- The new integer cannot have any leading zeros, also the new integer cannot be $0$.

Let $a$ and $b$ be the results of applying the operations to $num$ the first and second times, respectively.

Return the max difference between $a$ and $b$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDiff(int num) {
        int ma = 0;
        int mi = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int x = 0; x <= 9; ++x)
            for (int y = 0; y <= 9; ++y)
            {
                int n = num;
                int nn = 0;
                long long base = 1;
                int d = 0;
                
                while (n)
                {
                    // d is the current digit
                    d = n % 10;
                    
                    // if the current digit is x, we replace it by y.
                    if (d == x)
                        nn += y * base;
                    else
                        nn += d * base;
                    
                    n /= 10;
                    base *= 10;
                }
                
                // the leading digit is x and is going to be replaced by y which happens to be 0, skip.
                if (d == x && y == 0)
                    continue;
                
                if (nn)
                {
                    ma = max(ma, nn);
                    mi = min(mi, nn);
                }
            }
        
        return ma - mi;
    }
