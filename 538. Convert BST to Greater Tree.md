Given the $root$ of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(TreeNode *root, int &acc)
    {
        if (! root)
            return ;
        
        dfs(root->right, acc);
        
        acc = root->val += acc;
        
        dfs(root->left, acc);
    }
    
    TreeNode* convertBST(TreeNode* root) {
        int acc = 0;
        
        dfs(root, acc);
        
        return root;
    }
};
```
