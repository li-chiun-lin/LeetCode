There are **n** friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered **from 1 to n** in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the **i**-th friend brings you to the **(i+1)**-th friend for **1 <= i < n**, and moving clockwise from the **n**-th friend brings you to the **1**st friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:

- Start at the **1**st friend.
- Count the next **k** friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
- The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
- If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step **2** starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
- Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.

Given the number of friends, **n**, and an integer **k**, return the winner of the game.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rec(int n, int k)
    {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        
        return (rec(n - 1, k) + k) % n;
    }
    
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        return rec(n, k) + 1;
    }
};
```
