# Medium

You are given a list of songs where the $i$-th song has a duration of $time[i]$ seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by $60$. Formally, we want the number of indices $i$, $j$ such that $i < j$ with $(time[i] + time[j]) \mod 60 == 0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numPairsDivisibleBy60(vector<int>& time) {
        vector<int> rem(60);
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int t : time)
            ++ rem[t % 60];
        
        for (int r = 1; r < 30; ++r)
            cnt += rem[r] * rem[60 - r];
        
        if (rem[0])
            cnt += rem[0] * (rem[0] - 1) / 2;
        
        if (rem[30])
            cnt += rem[30] * (rem[30] - 1) / 2;
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
