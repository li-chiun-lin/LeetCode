# Hard

There is an $m \times n$ cake that needs to be cut into $1 \times 1$ pieces.

You are given integers $m$, $n$, and two arrays:

- $horizontalCut$ of size $m - 1$, where $horizontalCut[i]$ represents the cost to cut along the horizontal line $i$.
- $verticalCut$ of size $n - 1$, where $verticalCut[j]$ represents the cost to cut along the vertical line $j$.

In one operation, you can choose any piece of cake that is not yet a $1 \times 1$ square and perform one of the following cuts:

1. Cut along a horizontal line $i$ at a cost of $horizontalCut[i]$.
1. Cut along a vertical line $j$ at a cost of $verticalCut[j]$.

After the cut, the piece of cake is divided into two distinct pieces.

The cost of a cut depends only on the initial cost of the line and does not change.

Return the minimum total cost to cut the entire cake into $1 \times 1$ pieces.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumCost(int m, int n, vector<int>& horizontalCut, vector<int>& verticalCut) {
        sort(begin(horizontalCut), end(horizontalCut));
        sort(begin(verticalCut), end(verticalCut));
        int hCnt = 1;
        int vCnt = 1;
        int ans = 0;
        
        while (size(horizontalCut) && size(verticalCut))
        {
            if (horizontalCut.back() > verticalCut.back())
            {
                ans += horizontalCut.back() * vCnt;
                ++ hCnt;
                horizontalCut.pop_back();
            }
            else
            {
                ans += verticalCut.back() * hCnt;
                ++ vCnt;
                verticalCut.pop_back();
            }
        }
        
        while (size(horizontalCut))
        {
            ans += horizontalCut.back() * vCnt;
            ++ hCnt;
            horizontalCut.pop_back();
        }
        
        while (size(verticalCut))
        {
            ans += verticalCut.back() * hCnt;
            ++ vCnt;
            verticalCut.pop_back();
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
