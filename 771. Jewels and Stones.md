# Easy

You're given strings $jewels$ representing the types of stones that are jewels, and $stones$ representing the stones you have. Each character in $stones$ is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        set<char> ss(begin(jewels), end(jewels));
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (char c : stones)
            if (ss.count(c))
                ++ cnt;
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
