# Easy

You are given an integer array $nums$. Transform $nums$ by performing the following operations in the exact order specified:

1. Replace each even number with $0$.
1. Replace each odd numbers with $1$.
1. Sort the modified array in non-decreasing order.

Return the resulting array after performing these operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> transformArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Convert each number to its least significant bit (0 for even, 1 for odd)
        for (auto& x : nums) {
            x &= 1;
        }
        
        // Sort the transformed array (all 0s will come before all 1s)
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));
        
        return nums;
    }
};
```
