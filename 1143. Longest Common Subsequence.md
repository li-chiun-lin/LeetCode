Given two strings $text1$ and $text2$, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return $0$.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        int m = text1.size();
        int n = text2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
                dp[i][j] = text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1] 
                         ? dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                         : max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j]);
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
