# Easy

You are given a string **s** consisting of digits and an integer **k**.

A **round** can be completed if the length of **s** is greater than **k**. In one round, do the following:

1. **Divide** **s** into consecutive groups of size **k** such that the first **k** characters are in the first group, the next **k** characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than **k**.
1. **Replace** each group of **s** with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, **"346"** is replaced with **"13"** because **3 + 4 + 6 = 13**.
1. **Merge** consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than **k**, repeat from step **1**.

Return **s** after all rounds have been completed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string digitSum(string s, int k) {
        while (s.size() > k)
        {
            string ss = "";
            int sum = 0;
            int i = 0;
            
            while (i < s.size())
            {
                sum += s[i] - '0';
                
                if (++ i % k == 0)
                {
                    ss += to_string(sum);
                    sum = 0;
                }
            }
            
            if (i % k != 0)
                ss += to_string(sum);
            
            s = ss;
        }
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
