# Hard

You are given a 2D array $queries$, where $queries[i]$ is of the form $[l, r]$. Each $queries[i]$ defines an array of integers $nums$ consisting of elements ranging from $l$ to $r$, both inclusive.

In one operation, you can:

- Select two integers $a$ and $b$ from the array.
- Replace them with $floor(a / 4)$ and $floor(b / 4)$.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce all elements of the array to zero for each query. Return the sum of the results for all queries.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& queries) 
    {
        long long totalOperations = 0;

        // Process each query in the input
        for (const auto& query : queries) 
        {
            long long start = query[0], end = query[1];
            long long operations = 0;

            // Iterate over powers of 4 (1, 4, 16, 64, ...) up to 2^16 (65536)
            for (long long depth = 1, prevBound = 1; depth < 17; ++depth) 
            {
                long long currentBound = prevBound * 4LL; 

                // Compute intersection of the interval [start, end] with the range [prevBound, currentBound - 1]
                long long left = max(start, prevBound);
                long long right = min(end, currentBound - 1);
                
                if (right >= left) 
                {
                    operations += (right - left + 1) * depth; // If intersection exists, accumulate operations
                }

                prevBound = currentBound; // Move to the next range
            }

            // Since we can operate on two numbers at a time, we take the ceiling of operations/2
            totalOperations += (operations + 1) / 2;
        }

        return totalOperations;
    }
};
```
