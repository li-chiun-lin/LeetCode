# Medium

You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of substrings you can split $s$ into such that each substring starts with a distinct character (i.e., no two substrings start with the same character).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistinct(string s) {
        set<char> ss(begin(s), end(s));

        return size(ss);
    }
};
```
