You are given a string $s$.

You can perform the following process on $s$ any number of times:

- Choose an index $i$ in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index $i$ that is equal to $s[i]$, and at least one character to the right that is also equal to $s[i]$.
- Delete the closest character to the left of index $i$ that is equal to $s[i]$.
- Delete the closest character to the right of index $i$ that is equal to $s[i]$.

Return the minimum length of the final string $s$ that you can achieve.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) 
    {
        // Count the frequency of each character
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char ch : s) 
        {
            ++freq[ch - 'a'];
        }

        int result = 0;

        // Calculate the minimum length
        for (int count : freq) 
        {
            if (count < 3) 
            {
                result += count; // Add directly if count is less than 3
            } 
            else 
            {
                result += (count % 2 == 1) ? 1 : 2; // Add 1 for odd counts, 2 for even counts >= 3
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
