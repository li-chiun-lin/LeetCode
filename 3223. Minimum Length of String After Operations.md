You are given a string $s$.

You can perform the following process on $s$ any number of times:

- Choose an index $i$ in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index $i$ that is equal to $s[i]$, and at least one character to the right that is also equal to $s[i]$.
- Delete the closest character to the left of index $i$ that is equal to $s[i]$.
- Delete the closest character to the right of index $i$ that is equal to $s[i]$.

Return the minimum length of the final string $s$ that you can achieve.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        vector<int> cnt(26);

        for (int i = 0; i < size(s); ++i)
            ++ cnt[s[i] - 'a'];

        int ans = 0;

        for (auto& n : cnt)
        {
            if (n < 3)
                ans += n;
            else
                ans += n % 2 ? 1 : 2;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
