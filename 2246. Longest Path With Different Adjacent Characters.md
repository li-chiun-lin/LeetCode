# Hard

You are given a **tree** (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) **rooted** at node **0** consisting of **n** nodes numbered from **0** to **n - 1**. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array **parent** of size **n**, where **parent[i]** is the parent of node **i**. Since node **0** is the root, **parent[0] == -1**.

You are also given a string **s** of length **n**, where **s[i]** is the character assigned to node **i**.

Return the length of the **longest path** in the tree such that no pair of **adjacent** nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.

## My Solution

For each node, the longest path can only be one of the following possibilities:

1. Go through it: the longest path come from the parent and possibly go to one of its children.
2. Come across it: the longest path come from one of its children and possibly go to another child.
3. Has nothing to do with it.

We use DFS to visit every node and to find out the longest sub-path within its children, then

1. Check if the longest 2 of its sub-path and the node itself can form a longer path then the currently global recoord.
2. Return the longest sub-path plus itself to the caller, so that the caller can proceed its check.

public:
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>> &sub, string &str, int u, int &ret)
    {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        
        for (int v : sub[u])
        {
            // we have to go down nevertheless,
            // for that the final result might be at the button of some where,
            int r0 = dfs(sub, str, v, ret);
            
            // and it is not necessarily to have a valid link to current node.
            if (str[u] == str[v])
                continue;
            
            pq.push(r0);
        }

        if (pq.size() > 1)

            pq.pop();
            int r2 = pq.top();

            ret = max(ret, r1 + r2 + 1);
            return max(r1, r2) + 1;
        }

        int ret = 0;

        dfs(sub, str, 0, ret);
        
        return ret;
