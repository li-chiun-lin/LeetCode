# Hard

Given an $n \times n$ integer matrix $grid$, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.

A falling path with non-zero shifts is a choice of exactly one element from each row of $grid$ such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFallingPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        
        for (int r = 1; r < n; ++r)
        {
            // find the index of the minimal element in the previous row
            int min_idx = min_element(begin(grid[r - 1]), end(grid[r - 1])) - begin(grid[r - 1]);
            
            // for every column in the current row, except the column correspondence with `min_idx`,
            // update it with the minimal element in the previous row.
            for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c)
            {
                if (c == min_idx)
                    continue;
                
                grid[r][c] += grid[r - 1][min_idx];
            }
            
            // find the second minimal element in the previous row
            int min_idx2 = -1;
            
            for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c)
            {
                if (c == min_idx)
                    continue;
                
                if (min_idx2 == -1 || grid[r - 1][min_idx2] > grid[r - 1][c])
                    min_idx2 = c;
            }
            
            // update the one column that correspondence with `min_idx` 
            // with the second minimal element in the previous row
            grid[r][min_idx] += grid[r - 1][min_idx2];
        }
        
        return *min_element(begin(grid.back()), end(grid.back()));
    }
};
```
