The problem involves tracking the frequency of IDs in a collection that changes over time. You have two integer arrays, $nums$ and $freq$, of equal length $n$. Each element in $nums$ represents an ID, and the corresponding element in $freq$ indicates how many times that ID should be added to or removed from the collection at each step.

- Addition of IDs: If $freq[i]$ is positive, it means $freq[i]$ IDs with the value $nums[i]$ are added to the collection at step $i$.
- Removal of IDs: If $freq[i]$ is negative, it means $-freq[i]$ IDs with the value $nums[i]$ are removed from the collection at step $i$.

Return an array $ans$ of length $n$, where $ans[i]$ represents the count of the most frequent ID in the collection after the $i$-th step. If the collection is empty at any step, $ans[i]$ should be $0$ for that step.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> mostFrequentIDs(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& freq) {
        int n = size(nums);
        priority_queue<pair<long long, int>> pq;
        map<int, long long> mp;
        vector<long long> ans(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            mp[nums[i]] += freq[i];
            pq.push({mp[nums[i]], nums[i]});

            while (size(pq))
            {
                auto [a, x] = pq.top();

                if (mp[x] == a)
                    break;

                pq.pop();
                pq.push({mp[x], x});
            }

            ans[i] = pq.top().first;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
