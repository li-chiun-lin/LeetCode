You are given a tree rooted at node $0$ that consists of $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. The tree is represented by an array $parent$ of size $n$, where $parent[i]$ is the parent of node $i$. Since node $0$ is the root, $parent[0] == -1$.

You are also given a string $s$ of length $n$, where $s[i]$ is the character assigned to node $i$.

We make the following changes on the tree one time simultaneously for all nodes $x$ from $1$ to $n - 1$:

- Find the closest node $y$ to node $x$ such that $y$ is an ancestor of $x$, and $s[x] == s[y]$.
- If node $y$ does not exist, do nothing.
- Otherwise, remove the edge between $x$ and its current parent and make node $y$ the new parent of $x$ by adding an edge between them.

Return an array $answer$ of size $n$ where $answer[i]$ is the size of the subtree rooted at node $i$ in the final tree.

class Solution {
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& parent, string& s, int u, vector<stack<int>>& y)
    {
        int c = s[u] - 'a';

        if (size(y[c]))
            parent[u] = y[c].top();

        y[c].push(u);

        for (auto v : adj[u])
            dfs(adj, parent, s, v, y);

        y[c].pop();

        int cnt = 1;

        for (auto v : adj[u])
            cnt += dfs(adj, v, ans);

        return ans[u] = cnt;
