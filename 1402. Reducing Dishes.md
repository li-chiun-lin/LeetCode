# Hard

A chef has collected data on the $satisfaction$ level of his $n$ dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level.

Return the maximum sum of like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.

Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfaction(vector<int>& satisfaction) {
        sort(begin(satisfaction), end(satisfaction), greater<int>());
        
        int acc = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int x : satisfaction)
        {
            acc += x;
            sum += acc;
            ret = max(ret, sum);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
