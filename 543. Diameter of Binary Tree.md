Given the $root$ of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the $root$.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(TreeNode *root, int &d)
    {
        if (! root)
            return 0;
        
        int l = dfs(root->left, d);
        int r = dfs(root->right, d);

        d = max(d, l + r);
        
        return max(l, r) + 1;
    }
    
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int d = 0;
        dfs(root, d);
        
        return d;
    }
};
```
