# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed $m \times n$ binary matrix $grid$.

Let us call a non-empty subset of rows good if the sum of each column of the subset is at most half of the length of the subset.

More formally, if the length of the chosen subset of rows is $k$, then the sum of each column should be at most $floor(k / 2)$.

Return an integer array that contains row indices of a good subset sorted in ascending order.

If there are multiple good subsets, you can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, return an empty array.

A subset of rows of the matrix $grid$ is any matrix that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) rows from $grid$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> goodSubsetofBinaryMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int m = grid[0].size();
        vector<int> val;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int v = 0;

            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)
                v |= grid[i][j] << j;

            // find a row containg only 0's
            if (v == 0)
                return {i};

            val.push_back(v);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j)
                if ((val[i] & val[j]) == 0)
                    return {i, j};

        return {};
    }
};
```
