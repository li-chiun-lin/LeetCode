# Hard

There is an undirected tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $1$ to $n$, rooted at node $1$. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$.

Initially, all edges have a weight of $0$. You must assign each edge a weight of either $1$ or $2$.

The cost of a path between any two nodes $u$ and $v$ is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

You are given a 2D integer array $queries$. For each $queries[i] = [u_i, v_i]$, determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges in the path such that the cost of the path between $u_i$ and $v_i$ is odd.

Return an array $answer$, where $answer[i]$ is the number of valid assignments for $queries[i]$.

Since the answer may be large, apply modulo $10^9 + 7$ to each $answer[i]$.

Note: For each query, disregard all edges not in the path between node $u_i$ and $v_i$.
