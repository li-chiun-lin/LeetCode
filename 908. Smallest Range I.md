# Easy

You are given an integer array $nums$ and an integer $k$.

In one operation, you can choose any index $i$ where $0 \leq i < nums.length$ and change $nums[i]$ to $nums[i] + x$ where $x$ is an integer from the range $[-k, k]$. You can apply this operation at most once for each index $i$.

The score of $nums$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in $nums$.

Return the minimum score of $nums$ after applying the mentioned operation at most once for each index in it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestRangeI(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;
        int k2 = k * 2;
        
        return max(0, nums[right] - nums[left] - k2);
    }
};
```
