Given the $root$ of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

- The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
- The depth of the root of the tree is $0$. if the depth of a node is $d$, the depth of each of its children is $d + 1$.
- The lowest common ancestor of a set $S$ of nodes, is the node $A$ with the largest depth such that every node in $S$ is in the subtree with root $A$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Helper function to perform DFS and return both depth and the corresponding node
    pair<int, TreeNode*> dfs(TreeNode* node)
    {
        // Base case: if node is null, return depth -1 and null node
        if (!node)
            return {-1, nullptr};

        // Recursively get depth and node from left and right subtrees
        auto left = dfs(node->left);
        auto right = dfs(node->right);

        // If left subtree is deeper, propagate its node and increment depth
        if (left.first > right.first)
            return {left.first + 1, left.second};
        // If right subtree is deeper, propagate its node and increment depth
        else if (left.first < right.first)
            return {right.first + 1, right.second};
        // If both subtrees are of equal depth, current node is the LCA
        else
            return {left.first + 1, node};
    }

public:
    // Returns the lowest common ancestor of the deepest leaves
    TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root).second;
    }
};
```
