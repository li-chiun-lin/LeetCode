Given the $root$ of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

- The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
- The depth of the root of the tree is $0$. if the depth of a node is $d$, the depth of each of its children is $d + 1$.
- The lowest common ancestor of a set $S$ of nodes, is the node $A$ with the largest depth such that every node in $S$ is in the subtree with root $A$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    pair<int, TreeNode*> dfs(TreeNode* root)
    {
        if (! root)
            return {-1, NULL};
        
        auto l = dfs(root->left);
        auto r = dfs(root->right);
        
        if (l.first > r.first)
            return {l.first + 1, l.second};
        else if (l.first < r.first)
            return {r.first + 1, r.second};
        else
            return {r.first + 1, root};
    }
public:
    TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root).second;
    }
};
```
