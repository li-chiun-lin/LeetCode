# Hard

You are given a binary string $binary$. A subsequence of $binary$ is considered good if it is not empty and has no leading zeros (with the exception of "0").

Return the number of unique good subsequences of $binary$. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfUniqueGoodSubsequences(string binary) {
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<long long> dp(2);

        for (char c : binary)
            dp[c - '0'] = (dp[0] + dp[1] + c - '0') % mod;

        return (dp[0] + dp[1] + (binary.find("0") != string::npos)) % mod;
    }
};
```
