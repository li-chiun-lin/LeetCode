You are given a directed graph with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$, where each node has exactly one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented by a given 0-indexed integer array edges of length $n$, where $edges[i]$ indicates that there is a directed edge from node $i$ to node $edges[i]$.

The edge score of a node $i$ is defined as the sum of the labels of all the nodes that have an edge pointing to $i$.

Return the node with the highest edge score. If multiple nodes have the same edge score, return the node with the smallest index.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int edgeScore(vector<int>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<long long> score(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            score[edges[i]] += i;
        
        int m = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            if (score[m] < score[i])
                m = i;
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
