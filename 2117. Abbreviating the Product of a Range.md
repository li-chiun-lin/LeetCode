# Hard

You are given two positive integers **left** and **right** with **left <= right**. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range **[left, right]**.

Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:

1. Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as **C**.
    - For example, there are **3** trailing zeros in **1000**, and there are **0** trailing zeros in **546**.
1. Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as **d**. If **d > 10**, then express the product as **\<pre\>...\<suf\>** where **\<pre\>** denotes the first **5** digits of the product, and **\<suf\>** denotes the last **5** digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If **d <= 10**, we keep it unchanged.
    - For example, we express **1234567654321** as **12345...54321**, but **1234567** is represented as **1234567**.
1. Finally, represent the product as a string **"\<pre\>...\<suf\>eC"**.
    - For example, **12345678987600000** will be represented as **"12345...89876e5"**.

Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range **[left, right]**.
