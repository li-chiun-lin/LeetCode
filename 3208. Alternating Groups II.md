# Medium

There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers $colors$ and an integer $k$. The color of tile $i$ is represented by $colors[i]$:

- $colors[i] == 0$ means that tile $i$ is red.
- $colors[i] == 1$ means that tile $i$ is blue.

An alternating group is every $k$ contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its left and right tiles).

Return the number of alternating groups.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfAlternatingGroups(vector<int>& colors, int k) {
        int n = size(colors);
        int ans = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = 1;
        
        while (r < n + k - 1 && l < n)
        {
            int v = colors[l % n];
            
            while (r < n + k - 1 && colors[r % n] != v)
            {
                v = 1 - v;
                ++ r;
            }
            
            ans += max(r - l - k + 1, 0);
            l = r ++;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
