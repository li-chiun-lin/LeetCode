# Easy

A string s can be partitioned into groups of size **k** using the following procedure:

- The first group consists of the first **k** characters of the string, the second group consists of the next **k** characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
- For the last group, if the string does not have **k** characters remaining, a character **fill** is used to complete the group.

Note that the partition is done so that after removing the **fill** character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be **s**.

Given the string **s**, the size of each group k and the character **fill**, return a string array denoting the composition of every group **s** has been divided into, using the above procedure.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> divideString(string s, int k, char fill) {
        vector<string> ret;
        string r = "";
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
        {
            r.push_back(s[i]);
            
            if (r.size() == k)
            {
                ret.push_back(r);
                r = "";
            }
        }
        
        while (r.size() && r.size() < k)
            r += fill;
        
        if (r.size())
            ret.push_back(r);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
