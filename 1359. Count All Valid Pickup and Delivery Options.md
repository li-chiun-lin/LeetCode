# Hard

Given $n$ orders, each order consist in pickup and delivery services.

Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that $delivery(i)$ is always after of $pickup(i)$.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int m = 1e9 + 7;
    int countOrders(int n) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 1;
        
        long long t = (n * (2 * n - 1)) % m;
        
        return (t * countOrders(n - 1)) % m;
    }
};
```
