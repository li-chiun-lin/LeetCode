# Medium

You are given two positive integer arrays $spells$ and $potions$, of length $n$ and $m$ respectively, where $spells[i]$ represents the strength of the $i$th spell and $potions[j]$ represents the strength of the $j$th potion.

You are also given an integer $success$. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least $success$.

Return an integer array $pairs$ of length $n$ where $pairs[i]$ is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the $i$-th spell.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> successfulPairs(vector<int>& spells, vector<int>& potions, long long success) {
        int m = potions.size();
        int n = spells.size();
        vector<int> pairs(n);
        
        // this is critical
        sort(begin(potions), end(potions));
        
        // the lower_bound() will do all the magic.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            pairs[i] = end(potions) - lower_bound(begin(potions), end(potions), ceil((double)success / spells[i]));
        
        return pairs;
    }
};
```
