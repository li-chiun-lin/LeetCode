# Easy

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted $F(n)$ form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from $0$ and $1$. That is,

```text
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
```

Given $n$, calculate $F(n)$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int fib(int n) {
        if (n < 2)
            return n;
        
        int f0 = 0;
        int f1 = 1;
        int fn = 0;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i)
        {
            fn = f0 + f1;
            f0 = f1;
            f1 = fn;
        }
        
        return fn;
    }
};
```
