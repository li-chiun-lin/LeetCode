# Medium

You are given the **head** of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by **0**'s. The beginning and end of the linked list will have **Node.val == 0**.

For every two consecutive **0**'s, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any **0**'s.

Return the **head** of the modified linked list.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeNodes(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode *dh = new ListNode();
        ListNode *t = dh;
        
        while (head->val == 0 && head->next)
        {
            ListNode *ptr = head->next;
            int s = 0;
            
            while (ptr->val != 0)
            {
                s += ptr->val;
                ptr = ptr->next;
            }
            
            t ->next = new ListNode(s);
            t = t->next;
            
            head = ptr;
        }
        
        return dh->next;
    }
};
```
