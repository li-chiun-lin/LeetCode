# Hard

You are given a $m \times n$ matrix $grid$ consisting of non-negative integers where $grid[row] [col]$ represents the minimum time required to be able to visit the cell $(row, col)$, which means you can visit the cell $(row, col)$ only when the time you visit it is greater than or equal to $grid[row] [col]$.

You are standing in the top-left cell of the matrix in the $0$-th second, and you must move to any adjacent cell in the four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each move you make takes $1$ second.

Return the minimum time required in which you can visit the bottom-right cell of the matrix. If you cannot visit the bottom-right cell, then return $-1$.
