# Medium

There are $n$ cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array $flights$ where $flights[i] = [from_i, to_i, price_i]$ indicates that there is a flight from city $from_i$ to city $to_i$ with cost $price_i$.

You are also given three integers $src$, $dst$, and $k$, return the cheapest price from $src$ to $dst$ with at most $k$ stops. If there is no such route, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        vector<int> cost(n, INT_MAX);
        cost[src] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; ++i)
        {
            vector<int> tmp = cost;
            
            for (auto& f : flights)
                if (cost[f[0]] != INT_MAX)
                    tmp[f[1]] = min(tmp[f[1]], cost[f[0]] + f[2]);
            
            cost = tmp;
        }
        
        return cost[dst] == INT_MAX ? -1 : cost[dst];
    }
};
```
