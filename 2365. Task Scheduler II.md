# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers $tasks$, representing tasks that need to be completed in order, where $tasks[i]$ represents the type of the $i$-th task.

You are also given a positive integer $space$, which represents the minimum number of days that must pass after the completion of a task before another task of the same type can be performed.

Each day, until all tasks have been completed, you must either:

- Complete the next task from $tasks$, or
- Take a break.

Return the minimum number of days needed to complete all tasks.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long taskSchedulerII(vector<int>& tasks, int space) {
        long long day = 1;
        map<int, long long> prev;
        
        prev[tasks[0]] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < tasks.size(); ++i)
        {
            if (prev[tasks[i]])
            {
                int d = day - prev[tasks[i]];
                int delta = max(space - d, 0) + 1;
                
                day += delta;
            }
            else
            {
                ++ day;
            }
            
            prev[tasks[i]] = day;
        }
        
        return day;
    }
};
```
