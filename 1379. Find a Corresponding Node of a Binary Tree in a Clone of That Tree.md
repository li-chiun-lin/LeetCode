Given two binary trees **original** and **cloned** and given a reference to a node **target** in the original tree.

The **cloned** tree is a copy of the **original** tree.

Return a reference to the same node in the **cloned** tree.

Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the **target** node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the **cloned** tree.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* getTargetCopy(TreeNode* original, TreeNode* cloned, TreeNode* target) {
        if (original == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        if (original == target)
            return cloned;
        
        TreeNode* ptr = getTargetCopy(original->left, cloned->left, target);
        
        if (ptr)
            return ptr;
        
        return getTargetCopy(original->right, cloned->right, target);
    }
};
```
