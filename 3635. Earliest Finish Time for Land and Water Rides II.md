# Medium

You are given two categories of theme park attractions: land rides and water rides.

- Land rides
  - $landStartTime[i]$ – the earliest time the $i$-th land ride can be boarded.
  - $landDuration[i]$ – how long the $i$-th land ride lasts.
- Water rides
  - $waterStartTime[j]$ – the earliest time the $j$-th water ride can be boarded.
  - $waterDuration[j]$ – how long the $j$-th water ride lasts.

A tourist must experience exactly one ride from each category, in either order.

- A ride may be started at its opening time or any later moment.
- If a ride is started at time $t$, it finishes at time $t + duration$.
- Immediately after finishing one ride the tourist may board the other (if it is already open) or wait until it opens.

Return the earliest possible time at which the tourist can finish both rides.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Helper function to calculate the earliest finish time by performing
    // all tasks in group1 first, then group2
    int calc(const vector<int>& start1, const vector<int>& dur1,
             const vector<int>& start2, const vector<int>& dur2)
    {
        int n = start1.size();
        int m = start2.size();

        // Find the earliest possible completion time of any task from group1
        int finishTime1 = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            finishTime1 = min(finishTime1, start1[i] + dur1[i]);
        }

        // Based on finishTime1, compute the earliest possible finish time of group2
        int finishTime2 = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            if (finishTime1 >= start2[i]) {
                // If group1 finishes after the start of this group2 task, we can start immediately
                finishTime2 = min(finishTime2, finishTime1 + dur2[i]);
            } else {
                // Otherwise, we have to wait until this task's start time
                finishTime2 = min(finishTime2, start2[i] + dur2[i]);
            }
        }

        return finishTime2;
    }

public:
    // Compute the minimum time to finish all tasks by choosing the best order
    int earliestFinishTime(vector<int>& landStartTime, vector<int>& landDuration,
                           vector<int>& waterStartTime, vector<int>& waterDuration) {

        // Try both orders: land first then water, or water first then land
        int option1 = calc(landStartTime, landDuration, waterStartTime, waterDuration);
        int option2 = calc(waterStartTime, waterDuration, landStartTime, landDuration);

        // Return the earliest of both possible finish times
        return min(option1, option2);
    }
};
```
