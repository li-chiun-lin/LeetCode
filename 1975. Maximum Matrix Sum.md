You are given an **n x n** integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:

- Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by **-1**.

Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxMatrixSum(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int tar = INT_MAX;
        long long sum = 0;
        
        for (auto &v : matrix)
        {
            for (int x : v)
            {
                cnt += x < 0;
                x = abs(x);
                sum += x;
                tar = min(tar, x);
            }
        }
        
        if (cnt % 2)
            sum -= tar * 2;
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
