# Medium

There is a grid with $n + 2$ horizontal bars and $m + 2$ vertical bars, and initially containing $1 \times 1$ unit cells.

The bars are 1-indexed.

You are given the two integers, $n$ and $m$.

You are also given two integer arrays: $hBars$ and $vBars$.

- $hBars$ contains distinct horizontal bars in the range $[2, n + 1]$.
- $vBars$ contains distinct vertical bars in the range $[2, m + 1]$.

You are allowed to remove bars that satisfy any of the following conditions:

- If it is a horizontal bar, it must correspond to a value in $hBars$.
- If it is a vertical bar, it must correspond to a value in $vBars$.

Return an integer denoting the maximum area of a square-shaped hole in the grid after removing some bars (possibly none).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeSquareHoleArea(int n, int m, vector<int>& hBars, vector<int>& vBars) {
        map<int, int> h, v;
        int mh = 1, mv = 1;
        
        sort(begin(hBars), end(hBars));
        sort(begin(vBars), end(vBars));

        for (auto x : hBars)
        {
            h[x] = h[x - 1] + 1;
            mh = max(mh, h[x]);
        }
        
        for (auto x : vBars)
        {
            v[x] = v[x - 1] + 1;
            mv = max(mv, v[x]);
        }

        int mm = min(mh, mv) + 1;
        return mm * mm;
    }
};
```
