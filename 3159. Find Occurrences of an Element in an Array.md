You are given an integer array $nums$, an integer array $queries$, and an integer $x$.

For each $queries[i]$, you need to find the index of the $queries[i]$-th occurrence of $x$ in the $nums$ array. If there are fewer than $queries[i]$ occurrences of $x$, the answer should be $-1$ for that query.

Return an integer array $answer$ containing the answers to all queries.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> occurrencesOfElement(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& queries, int x) {
        vector<int> idx;
        vector<int> ans;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size(nums); ++i)
            if (nums[i] == x)
                idx.push_back(i);
        
        for (auto q : queries)
            ans.push_back(size(idx) < q ? -1 : idx[q - 1]);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
