# Medium

You have $n$ boxes. You are given a binary string $boxes$ of length $n$, where $boxes[i]$ is $'0'$ if the $i$-th box is empty, and $'1'$ if it contains one ball.

In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box. Box $i$ is adjacent to box $j$ if $abs(i - j) == 1$. Note that after doing so, there may be more than one ball in some boxes.

Return an array answer of size $n$, where $answer[i]$ is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the $i$-th box.

Each $answer[i]$ is calculated considering the initial state of the boxes.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minOperations(string boxes) {
        int n = boxes.size();
        vector<int> left(n), right(n), result(n);

        // Calculate moves for left-to-right pass
        for (int i = 1, count = (boxes[0] == '1'); i < n; ++i) {
            left[i] = left[i - 1] + count;
            count += (boxes[i] == '1');
        }

        // Calculate moves for right-to-left pass
        for (int i = n - 2, count = (boxes[n - 1] == '1'); i >= 0; --i) {
            right[i] = right[i + 1] + count;
            count += (boxes[i] == '1');
        }

        // Combine results
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            result[i] = left[i] + right[i];
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
