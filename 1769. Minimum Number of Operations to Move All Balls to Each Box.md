# Medium

You have **n** boxes. You are given a binary string **boxes** of length **n**, where **boxes[i]** is **'0'** if the **i**-th box is empty, and **'1'** if it contains one ball.

In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box. Box **i** is adjacent to box **j** if **abs(i - j) == 1**. Note that after doing so, there may be more than one ball in some boxes.

Return an array answer of size **n**, where **answer[i]** is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the **i**-th box.

Each **answer[i]** is calculated considering the initial state of the boxes.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minOperations(string boxes) {
        int n = boxes.size();
        vector<int> left(n), right(n), ret(n);
        
        // how many moves if we want to move all the balls at the left of index i to index i?
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            left[i] = left[i - 1] + (boxes[i - 1] == '1');
        
        // accumulate 
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            left[i] += left[i - 1];
        
        
        // from right to left
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)
            right[i] = right[i + 1] + (boxes[i + 1] == '1');
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)
            right[i] += right[i + 1];
        
        
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ret[i] = left[i] + right[i];

        return ret;
    }
};
```
