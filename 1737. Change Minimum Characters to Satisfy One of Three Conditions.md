# Medium

You are given two strings **a** and **b** that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in **a** or **b** to any lowercase letter.

Your goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions:

- Every letter in **a** is strictly less than every letter in **b** in the alphabet.
- Every letter in **b** is strictly less than every letter in **a** in the alphabet.
- Both **a** and **b** consist of only one distinct letter.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCharacters(string a, string b) {
        int m = a.size();
        int n = b.size();
        vector<int> ha(26), hb(26);
        
        // count the frequency
        for (char c : a)
            ++ ha[c - 'a'];
        
        for (char c : b)
            ++ hb[c - 'a'];
        
        //------------------------------
        // a < b
        int case1 = INT_MAX;  
        // count_a is indeed sum_a
        count_a = m;
        count_b = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < 26; ++i)
        {
            // for each char i, in order to make all char in a less than all char in b,
            // those chars in a that are larger than i must be change to i - 1.
            // those char in b that are smaller than i must be change to i.
            count_a -= ha[i - 1];
            count_b += hb[i - 1];
            
            case1 = min(case1, count_a + count_b);
        }
        
        //------------------------------
        // a > b, similar logic
        int case2 = INT_MAX;  
        int count_a = 0;
        int count_b = n;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < 26; ++i)
        {
            // change char in a less than i into i
            count_a += ha[i - 1];
            // change char in b larger than i into i - 1
            count_b -= hb[i - 1];
            
            case2 = min(case2, count_a + count_b);
        }
        
        //----------------------------
        // a == b
        int case3 = 0;
        
        // find the char with max frequency in both a and b
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
            case3 = max(case3, ha[i] + hb[i]);
        
        // change the rest of a and b into the dominating char
        case3 = n + m - case3;
        
        return min(case1, min(case2, case3));
    }
};
