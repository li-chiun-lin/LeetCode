There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array $points$ where $points[i] = [x_{start}, x_{end}]$ denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between $x_{start}$ and $x_{end}$. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with $x_{start}$ and $x_{end}$ is burst by an arrow shot at $x$ if $x_{start} \leq x \leq x_{end}$. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array $points$, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

```cpp
bool cmp(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b)
{
    return a[1] < b[1];
}

class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), cmp);
        
        int a = 1;
        int p = points[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); ++i)
            if (points[i][0] > p)
            {
                ++a;
                p = points[i][1];
            }
        
        return a;
    }
};
```
