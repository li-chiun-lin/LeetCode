# Medium

You are given an **m x n** matrix **maze** (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented as **'.'**) and walls (represented as '+'). You are also given the **entrance** of the maze, where **entrance = [entrance<sub>row</sub>, entrance<sub>col</sub>]** denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the nearest exit from the **entrance**. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the **maze**. The **entrance** does not count as an exit.

Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the **entrance** to the nearest exit, or **-1** if no such path exists.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int nearestExit(vector<vector<char>>& maze, vector<int>& entrance) {
        int m = maze.size();
        int n = maze[0].size();
        queue<pair<int, int>> que;
        int s = 0;
        int c = 0;
        int d[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        
        que.push({entrance[0], entrance[1]});
        maze[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = '-';
        
        while (s = que.size())
        {
            ++ c;
            
            while (s --)
            {
                int x = que.front().first;
                int y = que.front().second;
                que.pop();
                
                for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
                {
                    int xx = x + d[i];
                    int yy = y + d[i + 1];
                    
                    if (xx < 0 || yy < 0 || xx >= m || yy >= n || maze[xx][yy] != '.')
                        continue;
                    
                    if (xx == 0 || yy == 0 || xx == m - 1 || yy == n - 1)
                        return c;
                    
                    que.push({xx, yy});
                    maze[xx][yy] = '-';
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
