Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The mapping of digits to letters is shown in the figure below.

In order to add a letter, Alice has to press the key of the corresponding digit $i$ times, where $i$ is the position of the letter in the key.

However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a string of pressed keys instead.

Given a string $pressedKeys$ representing the string received by Bob, return the total number of possible text messages Alice could have sent.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTexts(string pressedKeys) {
        vector<int> dp(5, 1);
        int n = size(pressedKeys);
        int m = 1e9 + 7;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            dp[i % 5] = 0;

            int mx = min(n, i + (pressedKeys[i] == '7' || pressedKeys[i] == '9' ? 4 : 3));

            for (int j = i; j < mx && pressedKeys[i] == pressedKeys[j]; ++j)
                dp[i % 5] = (dp[i % 5] + dp[(j + 1) % 5]) % m;
        }

        return dp[0];
    }
};
```
