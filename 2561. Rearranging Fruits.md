# Hard

You have two fruit baskets containing $n$ fruits each. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays $basket1$ and $basket2$ representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets equal. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:

- Chose two indices $i$ and $j$, and swap the $i$-th fruit of $basket1$ with the $j$-th fruit of $basket2$.
- The cost of the swap is $min(basket1[i],basket2[j])$.

Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.

Return the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or $-1$ if impossible.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minCost(vector<int>& basket1, vector<int>& basket2) {
        map<int, long long> hit;
        long long swaps = 0;
        long long ret = 0;

        for (int x : basket1)
            ++ hit[x];

        for (int x : basket2)
            -- hit[x];

        for (auto& [k, v] : hit)
        {
            if (v % 2)
                return -1;
            // count for the positive
            swaps += max(0LL, v / 2);
        }

        for (auto& [k, v] : hit)
        {
            long long take = min(swaps, abs(v) / 2);
            // assumming x is the smallest value, 
            // it might be cheaper to swap(a, x) and than swap(x, b), 
            // which is an equivalent to swap(a, b), 
            // but only cost x * 2 instead of min(a, b).
            ret += take * min(k, begin(hit)->first * 2);
            swaps -= take;
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
```
