# Hard

You are given two integers $n$ and $k$ and two integer arrays $speed$ and $efficiency$ both of length $n$. There are $n$ engineers numbered from $1$ to $n$. $speed[i]$ and $efficiency[i]$ represent the speed and efficiency of the $i$-th engineer respectively.

Choose at most $k$ different engineers out of the $n$ engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.

The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.

Return the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPerformance(int n, vector<int>& speed, vector<int>& efficiency, int k) {
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<>> pq;
        vector<pair<int, int>> worker(n);
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            worker[i] = {efficiency[i], speed[i]};
        
        sort(begin(worker), end(worker), greater<>());
        
        long ret = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        long lb = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
        {
            sum += worker[i].second;
            lb = worker[i].first;
            ret = max(ret, sum * lb);
            
            pq.push(worker[i].second);
        }
        
        for (int i = k; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (worker[i].second <= pq.top())
                continue;
            
            sum += worker[i].second - pq.top();
            lb = worker[i].first;
            ret = max(ret, sum * lb);
            
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(worker[i].second);
        }
        
        return ret % mod;
    }
};
