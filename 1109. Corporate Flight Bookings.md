# Medium

There are $n$ flights that are labeled from $1$ to $n$.

You are given an array of flight bookings $bookings$, where $bookings[i] = [first_i, last_i, seats_i]$ represents a booking for flights $first_i$ through $last_i$ (inclusive) with $seats_i$ seats reserved for each flight in the range.

Return an array $answer$ of length $n$, where $answer[i]$ is the total number of seats reserved for flight $i$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> corpFlightBookings(vector<vector<int>>& bookings, int n) {
        vector<int> prefix(n + 2);
        
        for (auto& b : bookings)
        {
            prefix[b[0]] += b[2];
            prefix[b[1] + 1] -= b[2];
        }
        
        vector<int> ret(n);
        int acc = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ret[i] = acc += prefix[i + 1];
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
