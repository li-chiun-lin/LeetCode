# Medium

You are given an integer array $nums$. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of $0$. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., $nums[0]$ or $nums[nums.length - 1]$) which reduces the size of the array by $1$. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return $true$ if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return $true$. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

        int first = min(dfs(nums, l + 2, r, dp), dfs(nums, l + 1, r - 1, dp)) + nums[l];
        // vise versa
        int last = min(dfs(nums, l, r - 2, dp), dfs(nums, l + 1, r - 1, dp)) + nums[r];
