# Hard

Given an integer array $nums$, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of $nums$.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        long long ret = 0;
        vector<map<long long, int>> cnt(n);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j)
            {
                auto d = (long long)nums[i] - nums[j];
                int s = 0;
                
                if (cnt[j].find(d) != end(cnt[j]))
                    s = cnt[j][d];
                
                cnt[i][d] += s + 1;
                ret += s;
            }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
