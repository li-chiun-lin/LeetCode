# Medium

You are given an integer **total** indicating the amount of money you have. You are also given two integers **cost1** and **cost2** indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend **part or all** of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.

Return the **number of distinct ways** you can buy some number of pens and pencils.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long waysToBuyPensPencils(int total, int cost1, int cost2) {
        long long c = 0;
        
        // At most, we can have q1 pens.
        int q1 = total / cost1;
        
        // With every possible amount of pens, 
        for (int i = 0; i <= q1; ++i)
        {
            // This is what we have left after buying i pens.
            int r1 = total - (cost1 * i);
            
            // Since we don't have to use all the money, 
            // we can buy any amount of pencils between 0 and (r1 / cost2).
            c += (r1 / cost2) + 1;
        }
    
        return c;
    }
};
