# Medium

You are given a 2D 0-indexed array of strings, $access_times$, with size $n$. For each $i$ where $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$, $access_times[i][0]$ represents the name of an employee, and $access_times[i][1]$ represents the access time of that employee. All entries in $access_times$ are within the same day.

The access time is represented as four digits using a 24-hour time format, for example, "0800" or "2250".

An employee is said to be high-access if he has accessed the system three or more times within a one-hour period.

Times with exactly one hour of difference are not considered part of the same one-hour period. For example, "0815" and "0915" are not part of the same one-hour period.

Access times at the start and end of the day are not counted within the same one-hour period. For example, "0005" and "2350" are not part of the same one-hour period.

Return a list that contains the names of high-access employees with any order you want.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findHighAccessEmployees(vector<vector<string>>& access_times) {
        map<string, vector<int>> mp;
        vector<string> ans;
        
        for (auto& a : access_times)
        {
            for (int i = 1; i < size(a); ++i)
            {
                int h = (a[i][0] - '0') * 10 + a[i][1] - '0';
                int m = (a[i][2] - '0') * 10 + a[i][3] - '0';
                mp[a[0]].push_back(h * 60 + m);
            }
        }
        
        for (auto& [name, ts] : mp)
        {
            sort(begin(ts), end(ts));
            int m = size(ts);
            
            for (int i = 0; i + 2 < m; ++i)
                if (ts[i + 2] - ts[i] < 60)
                {
                    ans.push_back(name);
                    break;
                }
        }
        
        return ans;
