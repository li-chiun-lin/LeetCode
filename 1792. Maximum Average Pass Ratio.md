There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array **classes**, where $classes[i] = [pass_i, total_i]$. You know beforehand that in the **i**-th class, there are $total_i$ total students, but only $pass_i$ number of students will pass the exam.

You are also given an integer **extraStudents**. There are another **extraStudents** brilliant students that are guaranteed to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the **extraStudents** students to a class in a way that maximizes the average pass ratio across all the classes.

The pass ratio of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The average pass ratio is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.

Return the maximum possible average pass ratio after assigning the **extraStudents** students. Answers within $10^{-5}$ of the actual answer will be accepted.

```cpp
class Solution {

    // Calculate the increase in average if a class with m passing and n total students
    // gets one more passing student.
    double averageIncrease(double m, double n)
    {
        return (n - m) / (n * (n + 1));
    }

public:
    double maxAverageRatio(vector<vector<int>>& classes, int extraStudents) {
        // Max-heap storing increase in average and corresponding class index
        priority_queue<pair<double, int>> pq;

        // Populate the priority queue
        for (int i = 0; i < classes.size(); ++i)
            pq.push({averageIncrease(classes[i][0], classes[i][1]), i});

        // Assign extra students to maximize average increase
        while (extraStudents--)
        {
            int i = pq.top().second;
            pq.pop();

            // Assign one extra student
            ++classes[i][0];
            ++classes[i][1];

            // Recalculate and push back the new increase
            pq.push({averageIncrease(classes[i][0], classes[i][1]), i});
        }

        // Calculate the final average ratio
        double totalAverage = 0;
        for (const auto& cls : classes)
            totalAverage += static_cast<double>(cls[0]) / cls[1];

        return totalAverage / classes.size();
    }
};
```
