# Hard

You are given a directed graph of $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array $edges$ of size $n$, indicating that there is a directed edge from node $i$ to node $edges[i]$. If there is no outgoing edge from node $i$, then $edges[i] == -1$.

Return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return $-1$.

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCycle(vector<int>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<bool> visited(n);
        int ret = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (visited[i])
                continue;
            
            map<int, int> dst;
            
            for (int j = i, c = 0; edges[j] != -1; j = edges[j], ++c)
            {
                // we might find a loop or visisted an old path to some where, 
                if (visited[j])
                {
                    // yeap, we find a loop
                    if (dst.find(j) != dst.end())
                        ret = max(ret, c - dst[j]);
                    
                    break;
                }
                
                visited[j] = true;
                dst[j] = c;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
