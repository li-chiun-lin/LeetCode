# Medium

There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array $cardPoints$.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly $k$ cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array $cardPoints$ and the integer $k$, return the maximum score you can obtain.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
        int sum = accumulate(begin(cardPoints), begin(cardPoints) + k, 0);
        int n = cardPoints.size();
        int ret = sum;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
        {
            sum += cardPoints[n - 1 - i] - cardPoints[k - 1 - i];
            ret = max(ret, sum);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
