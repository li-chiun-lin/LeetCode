# Medium

You are given a positive integer array $grades$ which represents the grades of students in a university. You would like to enter all these students into a competition in ordered non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following conditions:

- The sum of the grades of students in the $i$-th group is less than the sum of the grades of students in the $(i + 1)$-th group, for all groups (except the last).
- The total number of students in the $i$-th group is less than the total number of students in the $(i + 1)$-th group, for all groups (except the last).

Return the maximum number of groups that can be formed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumGroups(vector<int>& grades) {
        int n = grades.size();
        int cnt = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int grp = 0;
        int c = 0;
        int s = 0;
        
        sort(begin(grades), end(grades));
        
        for (auto x : grades)
        {
            ++ c;
            s += x;
            
            if (c > cnt && s > sum)
            {
                cnt = c;
                sum = s;
                c = 0;
                s = 0;
                ++ grp;
            }
        }
        
        return grp;
    }
};
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumGroups(vector<int>& grades) {
        int ans = 0; 
        for (int i = 0, di = 1; i < grades.size(); i+= di) {
            ++ans; 
            ++di; 
        }
        return ans; 
    }
};
```
