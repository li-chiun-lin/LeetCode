# Easy

You are given an integer array $cost$ where $cost[i]$ is the cost of $i$-th step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index $0$, or the step with index $1$.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size();
        vector<int> dp(n + 2);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            dp[i + 2] = cost[i] + min(dp[i + 1], dp[i]);
        
        return min(dp[n], dp[n + 1]);
    }
};
```
