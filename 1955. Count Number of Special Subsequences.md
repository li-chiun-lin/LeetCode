A sequence is special if it consists of a positive number of 0s, followed by a positive number of 1s, then a positive number of 2s.

Given an array $nums$ (consisting of only integers 0, 1, and 2), return the number of different subsequences that are special. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSpecialSubsequences(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<long long> dp(3);
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;

        for (auto x : nums)
            dp[x] = (dp[x] + dp[x] + (x > 0 ? dp[x - 1] : 1)) % mod;

        return dp[2];
    }
};
```
