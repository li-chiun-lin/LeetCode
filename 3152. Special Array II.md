An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.

You are given an array of integer $nums$ and a 2D integer matrix $queries$, where for $queries[i] = [from_i, to_i]$ your task is to check that subarray $nums[from_i..to_i]$ is special or not.

Return an array of booleans $answer$ such that $answer[i]$ is true if $nums[from_i..to_i]$ is special.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> isArraySpecial(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> parity(n, 0);
        
        // Precompute parity information
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            parity[i] = parity[i - 1] + ((nums[i - 1] & 1) == (nums[i] & 1));
        }
        
        // Process queries
        vector<bool> answer;
        for (const auto& q : queries) {
            answer.push_back(parity[q[1]] == parity[q[0]]);
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
