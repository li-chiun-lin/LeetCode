# Hard

You are given a $m \times n$ matrix $mat$ of positive integers.

Return an integer denoting the number of ways to choose exactly one integer from each row of $mat$ such that the greatest common divisor of all chosen integers is $1$.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.
