# Hard

You are given an integer array $nums$ and an integer $k$.

In one operation, you can increase or decrease any element of $nums$ by exactly $k$.

You are also given a 2D integer array $queries$, where each $queries[i] = [l_i, r_i]$.

For each query, find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the subarray $nums[l_i..r_i]$ equal. If it is impossible, the answer for that query is $-1$.

Return an array $ans$, where $ans[i]$ is the answer for the $i$-th query.
