# Easy

Given the array $prices$ where $prices[i]$ is the price of the $i$-th item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the $i$-th item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to $prices[j]$ where $j$ is the minimum index such that $j > i$ and $prices[j] <= prices[i]$, otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an array where the $i$-th element is the final price you will pay for the $i$-th item of the shop considering the special discount.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> finalPrices(vector<int>& prices) {
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); ++i)
        {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < prices.size(); ++j)
            {
                if (prices[j] <= prices[i])
                {
                    prices[i] -= prices[j];
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return prices;
    }
};
```
