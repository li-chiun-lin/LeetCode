# Hard

Alice has an undirected tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$. The tree is represented as a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$ where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree.

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several guesses about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:

- Chooses two distinct integers $u$ and $v$ such that there exists an edge $[u, v]$ in the tree.
- He tells Alice that $u$ is the parent of $v$ in the tree.

Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array $guesses$ where $guesses[j] = [u_j, v_j]$ indicates Bob guessed $u_j$ to be the parent of $v_j$.

Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that at least $k$ of his guesses are true.

Given the 2D integer arrays $edges$, $guesses$ and the integer $k$, return the number of possible nodes that can be the root of Alice's tree. If there is no such tree, return $0$.

            // normally, correct_guess[v] should be euqal to correct_guess[u],
            // but if edge u -> v is a bob_guess, 
            // then when we set node v as root, edge u -> v will be reversed to v -> u,
            // thus no longer be a good guess.
            // on the other hand, we should increae the count if edge v -> u is a bob_guess.
