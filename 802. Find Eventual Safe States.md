There is a directed graph of $n$ nodes with each node labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array $graph$ where $graph[i]$ is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node $i$, meaning there is an edge from node $i$ to each node in $graph[i]$.

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) 
    {
        int n = graph.size(); // Number of nodes in the graph
        vector<vector<int>> reversedGraph(n); // Reversed graph representation
        vector<int> outDegree(n); // Out-degree of each node
        queue<int> safeNodesQueue; // Queue for nodes with zero out-degree
        vector<int> safeNodes; // Resultant list of safe nodes

        // Build the reversed graph and calculate out-degrees
        for (int u = 0; u < n; ++u) 
        {
            for (int v : graph[u]) 
            {
                reversedGraph[v].push_back(u); // Reverse the edge
            }
            outDegree[u] = graph[u].size(); // Count outgoing edges

            // If a node has no outgoing edges, it is initially safe
            if (outDegree[u] == 0) 
            {
                safeNodesQueue.push(u);
            }
        }

        // Topological sorting to find all safe nodes
        while (!safeNodesQueue.empty()) 
        {
            int current = safeNodesQueue.front();
            safeNodesQueue.pop();
            safeNodes.push_back(current);

            // Reduce the out-degree of connected nodes in the reversed graph
            for (int neighbor : reversedGraph[current]) 
            {
                if (--outDegree[neighbor] == 0) 
                {
                    safeNodesQueue.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        // Sort the safe nodes in ascending order
        sort(safeNodes.begin(), safeNodes.end());

        return safeNodes;
    }
};
