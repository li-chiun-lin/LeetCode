# Easy

You are given a string **s** consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer **k**.

First, convert **s** into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace **'a'** with **1**, **'b'** with **2**, ..., **'z'** with **26**). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits. Repeat the transform operation **k** times in total.

Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described above.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getLucky(string s, int k) {
        unsigned long long num = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
        {
            int d = s[i] - 'a' + 1;
            num += d / 10 + d % 10;
        }
        
        while (-- k > 0)
        {
            unsigned long long sum = 0;
            
            while (num)
            {
                sum += num % 10;
                num /= 10;
            }
            
            num = sum;
        }
        
        return num;
    }
};
```
