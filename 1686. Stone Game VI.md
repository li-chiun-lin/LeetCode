# Medium

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are $n$ stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can remove a stone from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob may value the stones differently.

You are given two integer arrays of length $n$, $aliceValues$ and $bobValues$. Each $aliceValues[i]$ and $bobValues[i]$ represents how Alice and Bob, respectively, value the $i$-th stone.

The winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are chosen. If both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a draw. Both players will play optimally. Both players know the other's values.

Determine the result of the game, and:

- If Alice wins, return $1$.
- If Bob wins, return $-1$.
- If the game results in a draw, return $0$.

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int stoneGameVI(vector<int>& aliceValues, vector<int>& bobValues) {
        int n = aliceValues.size();
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            pq.push({aliceValues[i] + bobValues[i], i});
        
        vector<int> score(2);
        int id = 0;
        
        while (pq.size())
        {
            score[id] += id ? bobValues[pq.top().second] : aliceValues[pq.top().second];
            
            pq.pop();
            id = 1 - id;
        }
        
        if (score[0] > score[1])
            return 1;
        else if (score[0] < score[1])
            return -1;
        else
            return 0;
    }
};
```
