Given a string **s**, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of **s**.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequence(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        map<char, vector<int>> idx;
        int cnt = 0;
        
        // record the index of each char
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            idx[s[i]].push_back(i);

        // for very char that has every appeared in s,
        for (auto &h : idx)
        {
            // if there the char appears on once, skip it.
            if (h.second.size() < 2)
                continue;
            
            // find how many identical chars are there in between.
            set<char> ss;
            
            for (int i = h.second.front() + 1; i < h.second.back(); ++i)
                ss.insert(s[i]);
            
            cnt += ss.size();
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
