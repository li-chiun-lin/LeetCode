Given a string $s$, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of $s$.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

        int n = s.size();
        unordered_map<char, vector<int>> charIndices;
        int count = 0;

        // Record the indices of each character in the string
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            charIndices[s[i]].push_back(i);
        }

        // Process each character that appears in the string
        for (const auto& [ch, indices] : charIndices)
        {
            // Skip characters that appear less than twice
            if (indices.size() < 2)
            {
                continue;
            }

            // Find unique characters between the first and last occurrence
            unordered_set<char> uniqueChars;
            for (int i = indices.front() + 1; i < indices.back(); ++i)
            {
                uniqueChars.insert(s[i]);
            }

            // Add the count of unique characters
            count += uniqueChars.size();
        }
