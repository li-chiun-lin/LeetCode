# Medium

You are given an array **time** where **time[i]** denotes the time taken by the **i**-th bus to complete one trip.

Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.

You are also given an integer **totalTrips**, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least **totalTrips** trips.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumTime(vector<int>& time, int totalTrips) {
        long long left = 1;
        long long right = 1e14;
        long long mid = 0;
        
        while (left < right)
        {
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long long c = 0;
            
            for (int t : time)
                c += mid / t;
            
            if (c >= totalTrips)
                right = mid;
            else
                left = mid + 1;
        }
        
        return left;
    }
};
```
