# Hard

Your car starts at position $0$ and speed $+1$ on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse):

- When you get an instruction 'A', your car does the following:
  - ```position += speed```
  - ```speed *= 2```
- When you get an instruction 'R', your car does the following:
  - If your speed is positive then ```speed = -1```
  - otherwise ```speed = 1```  
    Your position stays the same.

Given a target position $target$, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int racecar(int target) {
        queue<tuple<int, int, int>> que;
        que.push({0, 0, 1});

        while (size(que))
        {
            auto [step, pos, speed] = que.front();
            que.pop();

            if (pos == target)
                return step;

            if (abs(pos) > target * 2)
                continue;

            que.push({step + 1, pos + speed, speed * 2});

            if (pos + speed > target && speed > 0)
                que.push({step + 1, pos, -1});
            else if (pos + speed < target && speed < 0)
                que.push({step + 1, pos, 1});
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
