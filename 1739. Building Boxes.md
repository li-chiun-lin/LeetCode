# Hard

You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to $n$ units. You are asked to place $n$ boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:

- You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
- If box $x$ is placed on top of the box $y$, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box $y$ must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.

Given an integer $n$, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumBoxes(int n) {
        int cur = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while (cur < n)
            cur += i += ++ j;

        if (cur == n)
            return i;

        // cur > n
        cur -= i;
        i -= j;
        j = 0;

        while (cur < n)
            cur += ++ j;

        return i + j;
    }
};
```
