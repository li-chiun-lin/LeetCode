Tic-tac-toe is played by two players $A$ and $B$ on a $3 \times 3$ grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares **' '**.
- The first player **A** always places **'X'** characters, while the second player **B** always places **'O'** characters.
- **'X'** and **'O'** characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
- The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given a 2D integer array $moves$ where $moves[i] = [row_i, col_i]$ indicates that the $i$-th move will be played on $grid[row_i][col_i]$. return the winner of the game if it exists (**A** or **B**). In case the game ends in a draw return **"Draw"**. If there are still movements to play return **"Pending"**.

You can assume that $moves$ is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and **A** will play first.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string tictactoe(vector<vector<int>>& moves) {
        vector<map<int, int>> row(2), col(2), dia(2), ant(2);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < moves.size(); ++i)
        {
            int r = moves[i][0];
            int c = moves[i][1];
            int p = i % 2;
            
            if (++ row[p][r] == 3 ||
                ++ col[p][c] == 3 ||
                ++ dia[p][r + c] == 3 ||
                ++ ant[p][r - c] == 3)
                return p == 0 ? "A" : "B";
        }
        
        return moves.size() < 9 ? "Pending" : "Draw";
    }
};
```
