There are a total of $numCourses$ courses you have to take, labeled from $0$ to $numCourses - 1$. You are given an array $prerequisites$ where $prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that you must take course $a_i$ first if you want to take course $b_i$.

Prerequisites can also be indirect. If course $a$ is a prerequisite of course $b$, and course $b$ is a prerequisite of course $c$, then course $a$ is a prerequisite of course $c$.

You are also given an array $queries$ where $queries[j] = [u_j, v_j]$. For the $j$_th query, you should answer whether course $u_j$ is a prerequisite of course $v_j$ or not.

Return a boolean array $answer$, where $answer[j]$ is the answer to the $j$-th query.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> checkIfPrerequisite(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(numCourses);
        
        for (auto &p : prerequisites)
            adj[p[0]].push_back(p[1]);
        
        vector<vector<int>> isReachable(numCourses, vector<int>(numCourses));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i)
        {
            queue<int> que;
            que.push(i);
            
            while (que.size())
            {
                int u = que.front();
                que.pop();
                
                // this is the key to avoid repeating.
                if (isReachable[i][u])
                    continue;
                
                isReachable[i][u] = true;
                
                for (int v : adj[u])
                    que.push(v);
            }
        }
        
        vector<bool> ret;
        
        for (auto &q : queries)
            ret.push_back(isReachable[q[0]][q[1]]);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
