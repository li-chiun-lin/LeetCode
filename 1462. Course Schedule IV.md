There are a total of $numCourses$ courses you have to take, labeled from $0$ to $numCourses - 1$. You are given an array $prerequisites$ where $prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that you must take course $a_i$ first if you want to take course $b_i$.

Prerequisites can also be indirect. If course $a$ is a prerequisite of course $b$, and course $b$ is a prerequisite of course $c$, then course $a$ is a prerequisite of course $c$.

You are also given an array $queries$ where $queries[j] = [u_j, v_j]$. For the $j$_th query, you should answer whether course $u_j$ is a prerequisite of course $v_j$ or not.

Return a boolean array $answer$, where $answer[j]$ is the answer to the $j$-th query.
