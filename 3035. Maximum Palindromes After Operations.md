# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed string array $words$ having length $n$ and containing 0-indexed strings.

You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Choose integers $i, j, x,$ and $y$ such that $0 \leq i, j < n, 0 \leq x < words[i].length, 0 \leq y < words[j].length$, and swap the characters $words[i][x]$ and $words[j][y]$.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of palindromes $words$ can contain, after performing some operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPalindromesAfterOperations(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<int> freq(26);
        int cnt = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        vector<int> s;

        for (auto& w : words)
        {
            for (char c : w)
                ++ freq[c - 'a'];

            s.push_back(w.size());
        }

        for (auto f : freq)
            cnt += f / 2;

        sort(begin(s), end(s));

        for (int l : s)
            if ((cnt -= l / 2) >= 0)
                ++ ans;

        return ans;
    }
};
```
