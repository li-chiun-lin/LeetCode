# Medium

A cinema has $n$ rows of seats, numbered from $1$ to $n$ and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from $1$ to $10$.

Given the array $reservedSeats$ containing the numbers of seats already reserved.

Return the maximum number of four-person groups you can assign on the cinema seats. A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats in one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfFamilies(int n, vector<vector<int>>& reservedSeats) {
        int left = 0x0f << 2;
        int mid = 0x0f << 4;
        int right = 0x0f << 6;
        
        map<int, int> reserved;
        int cnt = n * 2;
        
        for (auto &r : reservedSeats)
            reserved[r[0]] |= 1 << r[1];
        
        for (auto &h : reserved)
        {
            int a = 0;
            if ((h.second & left) == 0)
            {
                ++ a;
                
                if ((h.second & right) == 0)
                    ++ a;
            }
            else if ((h.second & mid) == 0)
                ++ a;
            else if ((h.second & right) == 0)
                ++ a;
            
            cnt += a - 2;
        }
        
        return cnt;
        
    }
};
