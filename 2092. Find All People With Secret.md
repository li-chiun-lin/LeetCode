# Hard

You are given an integer $n$ indicating there are n people numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $meetings$ where $meetings[i] = [x_i, y_i, time_i]$ indicates that person $x_i$ and person $y_i$ have a meeting at $time_i$. A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer $firstPerson$.

Person $0$ has a secret and initially shares the secret with a person $firstPerson$ at time $0$. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person $x_i$ has the secret at $time_i$, then they will share the secret with person $y_i$, and vice versa.

The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.

Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.
