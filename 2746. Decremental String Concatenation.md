You are given a 0-indexed array $words$ containing $n$ strings.

Let's define a join operation $join(x, y)$ between two strings $x$ and $y$ as concatenating them into $xy$. However, if the last character of $x$ is equal to the first character of $y$, one of them is deleted.

For example $join$("ab", "ba") = "aba" and $join$("ab", "cde") = "abcde".

You are to perform $n - 1$ $join$ operations. Let $str_0 = words[0]$. Starting from $i = 1$ up to $i = n - 1$, for the ith operation, you can do one of the following:

- Make $str_i = join(str_{i - 1}, words[i])$
- Make $str_i = join(words[i], str_{i - 1})$

Your task is to minimize the length of $str_{n - 1}$.

Return an integer denoting the minimum possible length of $str_{n - 1}$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(char h, char t, int i, vector<string>& words, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& dp)
    {
        // end case: we have iterated through all the words.
        if (i == words.size())
            return 0;
        
        // memorized results
        if (dp[h - 'a'][t - 'a'][i])
            return dp[h - 'a'][t - 'a'][i];
        
        // the 'head', 'tail' and 'length' of words[i].
        char wh = words[i][0];
        char wt = words[i].back();
        char l = words[i].size();
        
        // case 1 prepend, remove 1 char if we must
        int r1 = l - (wt == h ? 1 : 0) + dfs(wh, t, i + 1, words, dp);
        
        // case 2 append, remove 1 char if we must
        int r2 = l - (t == wh ? 1 : 0) + dfs(h, wt, i + 1, words, dp);
        
        return dp[h - 'a'][t - 'a'][i] = min(r1, r2);
    }
    
public:
    int minimizeConcatenatedLength(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(26, 
            vector<vector<int>>(26, 
                vector<int>(words.size())));
        
        return dfs(words[0][0], words[0].back(), 1, words, dp) + words[0].size();
    }
};
