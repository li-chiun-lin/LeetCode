# Medium

You are given an integer array **cards** where **cards[i]** represents the value of the **i**-th card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value.

Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return **-1**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumCardPickup(vector<int>& cards) {
        map<int, vector<int>> idx;
        
        // record the index of each value of cards.
        for (int i = 0; i < cards.size(); ++i)
            idx[cards[i]].push_back(i);
        
        int ret = INT_MAX;
        
        // find the minimum difference between any of the two consecutive indexes.
        for (auto &h : idx)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < h.second.size(); ++i)
                for (int j = i + 1; j < h.second.size(); ++j)
                    ret = min(ret, h.second[j] - h.second[i] + 1);
        }
        
        // corner case when every card is unique.
        return ret == INT_MAX ? -1 : ret;
    }
};
```
