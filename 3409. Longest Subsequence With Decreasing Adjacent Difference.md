You are given an array of integers $nums$.

Your task is to find the length of the longest subsequence $seq$ of $nums$, such that the absolute differences between consecutive elements form a non-increasing sequence of integers. In other words, for a subsequence $seq_0, seq_1, seq_2, ..., seq_m$ of $nums$, $|seq_1 - seq_0| \geq |seq_2 - seq_1| \geq ... \geq |seq_m - seq_{m - 1}|$.

Return the length of such a subsequence.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& nums) {
        int numCount = nums.size(); // Number of elements in the sequence
        vector<int> lastIndex(305, 0); // Track the last index of each possible number (0 to 300)
        vector<vector<int>> subsequenceLength(numCount + 1, vector<int>(305, 0)); // DP table to store subsequence lengths
        vector<vector<int>> prefixMax(numCount + 1, vector<int>(305, 0)); // Prefix max table for optimization

        int longestLength = 0; // Variable to store the longest subsequence length found

        // DP computation
        for (int currentIndex = 1; currentIndex <= numCount; ++currentIndex) {
            subsequenceLength[currentIndex][300] = 1; // Base case: a subsequence of just one element

            // Update the DP table for each possible difference between elements
            for (int prevValue = 0; prevValue <= 300; ++prevValue) {
                if (lastIndex[prevValue] == 0) continue; // Skip if there's no previous occurrence of `prevValue`

                int diff = abs(prevValue - nums[currentIndex - 1]); // Calculate the absolute difference between current and previous values
                subsequenceLength[currentIndex][diff] = max(subsequenceLength[currentIndex][diff], prefixMax[lastIndex[prevValue]][diff] + 1);
            }

            // Update the prefix max table for the current index
            prefixMax[currentIndex][300] = subsequenceLength[currentIndex][300];
            for (int diff = 299; diff >= 0; --diff) {
                prefixMax[currentIndex][diff] = max(subsequenceLength[currentIndex][diff], prefixMax[currentIndex][diff + 1]);
            }

            // Update the last index where the current value has appeared
            lastIndex[nums[currentIndex - 1]] = currentIndex;
        }

        // Find the maximum subsequence length from the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i <= numCount; ++i) {
            for (int diff = 0; diff <= 300; ++diff) {
                longestLength = max(longestLength, subsequenceLength[i][diff]);
            }
        }

        return longestLength;
    }
};
