# Easy

Given a string $s$, calculate its reverse degree.

The reverse degree is calculated as follows:

- For each character, multiply its position in the reversed alphabet ('a' = 26, 'b' = 25, ..., 'z' = 1) with its position in the string (1-indexed).
- Sum these products for all characters in the string.

Return the reverse degree of $s$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reverseDegree(const string& s) 
    {
        int reverseDegreeSum = 0;
        int length = s.size();
        
        // Iterate through the string and compute the reverse degree
        for (int index = 0; index < length; ++index) 
        {
            int positionWeight = index + 1; // Position in the string (1-based index)
            int reverseAlphabetIndex = 26 - (s[index] - 'a'); // Reverse alphabetical order
            
            reverseDegreeSum += positionWeight * reverseAlphabetIndex;
        }
        
        return reverseDegreeSum;
    }
};
```
