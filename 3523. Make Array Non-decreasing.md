# Medium

You are given an integer array $nums$. In one operation, you can select a subarray and replace it with a single element equal to its maximum value.

Return the maximum possible size of the array after performing zero or more operations such that the resulting array is non-decreasing.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Returns the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence
    // that can be formed by iterating left to right and picking valid elements.
    int maximumPossibleSize(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int previous = -1;

        // Iterate through the array and count elements that maintain non-decreasing order
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (previous <= x) {
                // Valid to include current element
                previous = x;
                ++count;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
