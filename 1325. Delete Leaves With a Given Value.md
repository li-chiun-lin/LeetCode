Given a binary tree $root$ and an integer $target$, delete all the leaf nodes with value $target$.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value $target$, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value $target$, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        if (! root)
            return root;
        
        root->left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
        root->right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);
        
        if (root->left == root->right && root->val == target)
            return NULL;
        
        return root;
    }
};
```
