Design a food rating system that can do the following:

- Modify the rating of a food item listed in the system.
- Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.

Implement the **FoodRatings** class:

- **FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings)** Initializes the system. The food items are described by $foods$, $cuisines$ and $ratings$, all of which have a length of $n$.
  - $foods[i]$ is the name of the $i$-th food,
  - $cuisines[i]$ is the type of cuisine of the $i$-th food, and
  - $ratings[i]$ is the initial rating of the $i$-th food.
- **void changeRating(String food, int newRating)** Changes the rating of the food item with the name $food$.
- **String highestRated(String cuisine)** Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of $cuisine$. If there is a tie, return the item with the lexicographically smaller name.

```cpp
class FoodRatings {
    map<string, pair<int, string>> food_rating_cuisines;
    // we might use priority_queue here instead of set, 
    // with a customized comparator, it will simplify the hightestRated().
    map<string, set<pair<int, string>>> cuisines_rating_food;
    
public:
    FoodRatings(vector<string>& foods, vector<string>& cuisines, vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = foods.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            add(foods[i], cuisines[i], ratings[i]);
    }
    
    void add(string& f, string& c, int r)
    {
        food_rating_cuisines[f] = {r, c};
        cuisines_rating_food[c].insert({r, f});
    }
    
    void changeRating(string food, int newRating) {
        int old_rating = food_rating_cuisines[food].first;
        string cuisines = food_rating_cuisines[food].second;
        cuisines_rating_food[cuisines].erase({old_rating, food});
        
        add(food, cuisines, newRating);
    }
    
    string highestRated(string cuisine) {
        int r = cuisines_rating_food[cuisine].rbegin()->first;
        string f = cuisines_rating_food[cuisine].rbegin()->second;
        
        for (auto it = cuisines_rating_food[cuisine].rbegin(); it != cuisines_rating_food[cuisine].rend() && it->first == r; ++it)
            f = min(f, it->second);
        
        return f;
    }
};
```
