You are given an integer array $nums$ that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Determine if it is possible to split $nums$ into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:

- Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).
- All subsequences have a length of $3$ or more.

Return $true$ if you can split $nums$ according to the above conditions, or $false$ otherwise.

A subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> hit;
        map<int, int> dp;
        
        for (int x : nums)
            ++ hit[x];
        
        for (int x : nums)
        {
            if (hit[x] == 0)
                continue;
            
            -- hit[x];
            
            // extend existed sequence to include x
            if (dp[x - 1])
            {
                -- dp[x - 1];
                ++ dp[x];
            }
            // look forward for a new sequence start from x
            else if(hit[x + 1] && hit[x + 2])
            {
                -- hit[x + 1];
                -- hit[x + 2];
                ++ dp[x + 2];
            }
            // oops, x is left between some sequences
            else
                return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
