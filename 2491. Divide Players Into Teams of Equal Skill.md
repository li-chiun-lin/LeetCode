# Medium

You are given a positive integer array $skill$ of even length $n$ where $skill[i]$ denotes the skill of the $i$-th player. Divide the players into $n / 2$ teams of size $2$ such that the total skill of each team is equal.

The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.

Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return $-1$ if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long dividePlayers(vector<int>& skill) {
        int n = skill.size();
        int n2 = n / 2;
        long long sum = accumulate(begin(skill), end(skill), 0);
        
        if (sum * 2 % n)
            return -1;
        
        auto div = sum * 2 / n;
        long long chemistry = 0;
        
        sort(begin(skill), end(skill));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n2; ++i)
        {
            if (skill[i] + skill[n - 1 - i] != div)
                return -1;
            
            chemistry += (long long)skill[i] * skill[n - 1 - i];
        }
        
        return chemistry;
    }
};
```
