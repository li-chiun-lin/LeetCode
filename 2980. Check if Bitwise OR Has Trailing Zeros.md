# Easy

You are given an array of positive integers $nums$.

You have to check if it is possible to select two or more elements in the array such that the bitwise OR of the selected elements has at least one trailing zero in its binary representation.

Return $true$ if it is possible to select two or more elements whose bitwise OR has trailing zeros, return $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasTrailingZeros(vector<int>& nums) {
        return accumulate(begin(nums), end(nums), 0, [](int lhs, int rhs)
        {
            return lhs + (1 - (rhs & 1));
        }) >= 2;
    }
};
```
