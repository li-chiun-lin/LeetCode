# Easy

You are given an integer array $nums$.

Start by selecting a starting position $curr$ such that $nums[curr] == 0$, and choose a movement direction of either left or right.

After that, you repeat the following process:

- If $curr$ is out of the range $[0, n - 1]$, this process ends.
- If $nums[curr] == 0$, move in the current direction by incrementing $curr$ if you are moving right, or decrementing $curr$ if you are moving left.
- Else if $nums[curr] > 0$:
  - Decrement $nums[curr]$ by $1$.
  - Reverse your movement direction (left becomes right and vice versa).
  - Take a step in your new direction.

A selection of the initial position $curr$ and movement direction is considered valid if every element in $nums$ becomes $0$ by the end of the process.

Return the number of possible valid selections.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countValidSelections(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();       // Total number of elements in the input array
        int leftSum = 0;           // Cumulative sum of elements to the left of the current position
        int rightSum = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0); // Initial sum of all elements in nums
        int ans = 0;               // Tracks the count of valid starting positions and directions

        for (int x : nums) {       // Iterate through each element in nums
            rightSum -= x;         // Remove the current element from the right sum

            // Check if the current position is valid as a starting point
            if (x == 0) {          
                if (leftSum == rightSum) 
                    ans += 2;      // If leftSum equals rightSum, both directions are valid
                else if (abs(leftSum - rightSum) == 1)
                    ans += 1;      // If the difference is 1, only one direction is valid
            }

            leftSum += x;          // Add the current element to the left sum
        }

        return ans;                // Return the total number of valid starting positions
    }
};
