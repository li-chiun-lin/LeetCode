# Medium

You are given two string arrays $creators$ and $ids$, and an integer array $views$, all of length $n$. The $i$-th video on a platform was created by $creator[i]$, has an id of $ids[i]$, and has $views[i]$ views.

The popularity of a creator is the sum of the number of views on all of the creator's videos. Find the creator with the highest popularity and the id of their most viewed video.

- If multiple creators have the highest popularity, find all of them.
- If multiple videos have the highest view count for a creator, find the lexicographically smallest id.

Return a 2D array of strings $answer$ where $answer[i] = [creator_i, id_i]$ means that $creator_i$ has the highest popularity and $id_i$ is the id of their most popular video. The answer can be returned in any order.
