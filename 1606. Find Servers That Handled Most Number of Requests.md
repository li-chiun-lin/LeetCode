# Hard

You have $k$ servers numbered from $0$ to $k-1$ that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:

- The $i$-th (0-indexed) request arrives.
- If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
- If the $(i \mod k)$-th server is available, assign the request to that server.
- Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary).

You are given a strictly increasing array $arrival$ of positive integers, where $arrival[i]$ represents the arrival time of the $i$-th request, and another array $load$, where $load[i]$ represents the load of the $i$-th request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.

Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> busiestServers(int k, vector<int>& arrival, vector<int>& load) {
        int n = size(arrival);
        vector<int> cnt(k);
        set<int> availiable;

        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * k - 1; ++i)
            availiable.insert(i);

        priority_queue<
            pair<int, int>, 
            vector<pair<int, int>>, 
            greater<>
            > pq;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int t = arrival[i];
            int l = load[i];

            while (size(pq) && pq.top().first <= t)
            {
                int s = pq.top().second;
                pq.pop();
                availiable.insert(s);
                availiable.insert(s + k);
            }

            if (size(availiable))
            {
                int s = (*availiable.lower_bound(i % k)) % k;
                availiable.erase(s % k);
                availiable.erase(s % k + k);

                ++ cnt[s];
                pq.push({t + l, s});
            }
        }

        int max_val = *max_element(begin(cnt), end(cnt));
        vector<int> ans;

        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
            if (cnt[i] == max_val)
                ans.push_back(i);

        return ans;
    }
};
