# Medium

You are given a string $s$ consisting only of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Choose any character $c$ in the string and replace every occurrence of $c$ with the next lowercase letter in the English alphabet.

Return the minimum number of operations required to transform $s$ into a string consisting of only 'a' characters.

Note: Consider the alphabet as circular, thus 'a' comes after 'z'.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(string s) {
        set<char> ss(begin(s), end(s));

        char c = *begin(ss);

        if (size(ss) == 1 && c == 'a')
            return 0;
        
        if (c == 'a')
            c = *next(begin(ss));

        return 'z' + 1 - c;
    }
};
```
