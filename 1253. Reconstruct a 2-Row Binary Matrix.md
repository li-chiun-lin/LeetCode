Given the following details of a matrix with $n$ columns and $2$ rows :

- The matrix is a binary matrix, which means each element in the matrix can be $0$ or $1$.
- The sum of elements of the 0-th(upper) row is given as $upper$.
- The sum of elements of the 1-st(lower) row is given as $lower$.
- The sum of elements in the $i$-th column(0-indexed) is $colsum[i]$, where $colsum$ is given as an integer array with length $n$.

Your task is to reconstruct the matrix with $upper$, $lower$ and $colsum$.

Return it as a 2-D integer array.

If there are more than one valid solution, any of them will be accepted.

If no valid solution exists, return an empty 2-D array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructMatrix(int upper, int lower, vector<int>& colsum) {
        int n = colsum.size();
        vector<vector<int>> ret(2, vector<int>(n));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            upper -= ret[0][i] = colsum[i] == 2 || (colsum[i] == 1 && upper > lower);
            lower -= ret[1][i] = colsum[i] == 2 || (colsum[i] == 1 && ret[0][i] == 0);
        }
        
        return (upper == 0 && lower == 0) ? ret : vector<vector<int>>();
    }
};
```
