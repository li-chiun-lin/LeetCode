# Easy

You are given an array *items*, where each $items[i] = [type_i, color_i, name_i]$ describes the type, color, and name of the *i*-th item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, *ruleKey* and *ruleValue*.

The *i*-th item is said to match the rule if one of the following is _true_:

- $ruleKey == "type"$ and $ruleValue == type_i$.
- $ruleKey == "color"$ and $ruleValue == color_i$.
- $ruleKey == "name"$ and $ruleValue == name_i$.

Return the number of items that match the given rule.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countMatches(vector<vector<string>>& items, string ruleKey, string ruleValue) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int key = 0;
        
        if (ruleKey == "type")
            key = 0;
        else if (ruleKey == "color")
            key = 1;
        else if (ruleKey == "name")
            key = 2;
        
        for (auto &i : items)
            if (i[key] == ruleValue)
                ++ cnt;

        return cnt;
    }
};
```
