You have information about $n$ different recipes. You are given a string array $recipes$ and a 2D string array $ingredients$. The $i$-th recipe has the name $recipes[i]$, and you can create it if you have all the needed ingredients from $ingredients[i]$. Ingredients to a recipe may need to be created from other recipes, i.e., $ingredients[i]$ may contain a string that is in $recipes$.

You are also given a string array $supplies$ containing all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.

Return a list of all the recipes that you can create. You may return the answer in any order.

Note that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findAllRecipes(vector<string>& recipes, vector<vector<string>>& ingredients, vector<string>& supplies) {
        int n = recipes.size();
        map<string, int> inDegree; // Tracks the number of ingredients needed for each recipe
        map<string, vector<string>> dependencyGraph; // Maps ingredients to recipes that depend on them
        vector<string> result; // Stores the recipes that can be made
        
        // Build the dependency graph and initialize in-degrees
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            inDegree[recipes[i]] = ingredients[i].size();
            for (string &ingredient : ingredients[i]) {
                dependencyGraph[ingredient].push_back(recipes[i]);
            }
        }
        
        queue<string> processQueue; // Queue to process available supplies
        
        // Add initial supplies to the queue
        for (string &supply : supplies) {
            processQueue.push(supply);
        }
        
        // Process the queue and determine which recipes can be made
        while (!processQueue.empty()) {
            string availableItem = processQueue.front();
            processQueue.pop();
            
            for (string &dependentRecipe : dependencyGraph[availableItem]) {
                if (--inDegree[dependentRecipe] == 0) { // If all ingredients are available
                    result.push_back(dependentRecipe);
                    processQueue.push(dependentRecipe);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
