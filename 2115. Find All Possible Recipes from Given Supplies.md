You have information about **n** different recipes. You are given a string array **recipes** and a 2D string array **ingredients**. The **i**-th recipe has the name **recipes[i]**, and you can create it if you have all the needed ingredients from **ingredients[i]**. Ingredients to a recipe may need to be created from other recipes, i.e., **ingredients[i]** may contain a string that is in **recipes**.

You are also given a string array **supplies** containing all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.

Return a list of all the recipes that you can create. You may return the answer in any order.

Note that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findAllRecipes(vector<string>& recipes, vector<vector<string>>& ingredients, vector<string>& supplies) {
        int n = recipes.size();
        map<string, int> deg;
        map<string, vector<string>> adj;
        vector<string> ret;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            deg[recipes[i]] = ingredients[i].size();
            
            for (string &j : ingredients[i])
                adj[j].push_back(recipes[i]);
        }
        
        queue<string> que;
        
        for (string &s : supplies)
            que.push(s);
        
        while (que.size())
        {
            string u = que.front();
            que.pop();
            
            for (string &v : adj[u])
                if (-- deg[v] == 0)
                {
                    ret.push_back(v);
                    que.push(v);
                }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
