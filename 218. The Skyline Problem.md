# Hard

A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array $buildings$ where $buildings[i] = [left_i, right_i, height_i]$:

- $left_i$ is the x coordinate of the left edge of the $i$-th building.
- $right_i$ is the x coordinate of the right edge of the $i$-th building.
- $height_i$ is the height of the $i$-th building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height $0$.

The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form $[[x_1,y_1],[x_2,y_2],\dots]$. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate $0$ and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> getSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& buildings) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        int i = 0;
        int x = 0;
        int h = -1;
        int n = buildings.size();
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
        
        while (i < n || pq.size())
        {
            x = pq.size() ? pq.top().second : buildings[i][0];
            
            if (i >= n || buildings[i][0] > x)
            {
                while (pq.size() && pq.top().second <= x)
                    pq.pop();
            }
            else
            {
                x = buildings[i][0];
                
                while(i < n && buildings[i][0] == x)
                {
                    pq.push({buildings[i][2], buildings[i][1]});
                    ++ i;
                }
            }
            
            h = pq.size() ? pq.top().first : 0;
            
            if (ret.empty() || ret.back()[1] != h)
                ret.push_back({x, h});
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
