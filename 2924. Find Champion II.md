There are $n$ teams numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$ in a tournament; each team is also a node in a DAG.

You are given the integer $n$ and a 0-indexed 2D integer array $edges$ of length $m$ representing the DAG, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates that there is a directed edge from team $u_i$ to team $v_i$ in the graph.

A directed edge from $a$ to $b$ in the graph means that team $a$ is stronger than team $b$ and team $b$ is weaker than team $a$.

Team $a$ will be the champion of the tournament if there is no team $b$ that is stronger than team $a$.

Return the team that will be the champion of the tournament if there is a unique champion, otherwise, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findChampion(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<int> deg(n);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
            ++ deg[e[1]];
        
        int cnt = 0;
        int ans = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (deg[i] == 0)
            {
                ++ cnt;
                ans = i;
            }
        
        return cnt == 1 ? ans : -1;
    }
};
```
