# Easy

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the $0$'s to $1$'s and all the $1$'s to $0$'s in its binary representation.

Given an integer $num$, return its complement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        int ret = 0;
        int mask = 1;
        
        while (num)
        {
            if ((num & 1) == 0)
                ret |= mask;
            
            mask <<= 1;
            num >>= 1;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
