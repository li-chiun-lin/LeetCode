# Hard

You are given an $m \times n$ integer array $grid$ where $grid[i][j]$ could be:

- $1$ representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
- $2$ representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
- $0$ representing empty squares we can walk over.
- $-1$ representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int l)
    {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] == -1)
            return 0;
        
        if (grid[i][j] == 2)
            return l == 0;

        grid[i][j] = -1;
        
        -- l;
