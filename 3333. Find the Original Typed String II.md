# Hard

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

You are given a string $word$, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen. You are also given a positive integer $k$.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size at least $k$.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int possibleStringCount(string word, int k) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = word.size();
        long long totalWays = 1;

        // Step 1: Tokenize the string into consecutive character run-lengths
        vector<int> runs;  // Each element is the length of a block of same characters
        int currentLength = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (word[i] == word[i - 1]) {
                ++currentLength;
            } else {
                runs.push_back(currentLength);
                currentLength = 1;
            }
        }
        runs.push_back(currentLength);  // Add last run

        // Step 2: Total number of strings is the product of run lengths
        for (int len : runs) {
            totalWays = totalWays * len % MOD;
        }

        int numRuns = runs.size();

        // Step 3: DP to count invalid combinations with fewer than k parts
        // dp[toggle][j] = number of ways to split the first i runs into j parts
        vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(k + 1));
        vector<long long> prefixSum(k + 1);  // For prefix sum optimization

        int curr = 0, prev = 1;

        // Base case: from first run, we can split into j parts (1 to min(run length, k-1))
        for (int j = 1; j <= min(runs[0], k - 1); ++j) {
            dp[prev][j] = 1;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < min(numRuns, k); ++i) {
            // Build prefix sum from dp[prev]
            prefixSum[0] = dp[prev][0];
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
                prefixSum[j] = (prefixSum[j - 1] + dp[prev][j]) % MOD;
            }

            // dp[curr][j] = sum of dp[prev][j'] where j' in [max(j - run[i], i), j-1]
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
                int left = max(j - runs[i], i);
                dp[curr][j] = (prefixSum[j - 1] - prefixSum[left - 1] + MOD) % MOD;
            }

            swap(curr, prev);
        }

        // Step 4: Subtract all invalid combinations with < k parts
        for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
            totalWays = (totalWays - dp[prev][j] + MOD) % MOD;
        }

        return static_cast<int>(totalWays);
    }
