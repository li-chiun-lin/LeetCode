# Easy

You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the maximum difference between the frequency of two characters in the string such that:

- One of the characters has an even frequency in the string.
- The other character has an odd frequency in the string.

Return the maximum difference, calculated as the frequency of the character with an odd frequency minus the frequency of the character with an even frequency.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    int maxDifference(string s) 
    {
        // Frequency array to count occurrences of each lowercase letter
        vector<int> frequency(26, 0);

        for (char c : s) 
        {
            frequency[c - 'a']++;
        }

        int maxOdd = 0;            // Maximum frequency among odd counts
        int minEven = INT_MAX;     // Minimum frequency among even counts

        for (int count : frequency) 
        {
            if (count == 0) 
            {
                continue; // Skip characters not present in the string
            }

            if (count % 2 == 1) 
            {
                // Update maxOdd if this odd count is larger
                maxOdd = max(maxOdd, count);
            } 
            else 
            {
                // Update minEven if this even count is smaller
                minEven = min(minEven, count);
            }
        }

        // If no even frequencies were found, treat minEven as 0 for subtraction
        if (minEven == INT_MAX) 
        {
            minEven = 0;
        }

        return maxOdd - minEven;
    }
};
