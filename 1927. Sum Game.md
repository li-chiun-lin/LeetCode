# Medium

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

You are given a string $num$ of even length consisting of digits and '?' characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one '?' in $num$:

- Choose an index $i$ where $num[i] ==$ '?'.
- Replace $num[i]$ with any digit between '0' and '9'.

The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in $num$.

For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of $num$ must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return $true$ if Alice will win and $false$ if Bob will win.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool sumGame(string num) {
        double ans = 0;
        int n = size(num);

        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i)
            ans += num[i] == '?' ? 4.5 : num[i] - '0';

        for (int i = n / 2; i < n; ++i)
            ans -= num[i] == '?' ? 4.5 : num[i] - '0';

        return ans != 0;
    }
};
```
