# Easy

You are given an integer $n$ representing the number of players in a game and a 2D array $pick$ where $pick[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ represents that the player $x_i$ picked a ball of color $y_i$.

Player $i$ wins the game if they pick strictly more than $i$ balls of the same color. In other words,

- Player $0$ wins if they pick any ball.
- Player $1$ wins if they pick at least two balls of the same color.
- ...
- Player $i$ wins if they pick at least $i + 1$ balls of the same color.

Return the number of players who win the game.

Note that multiple players can win the game.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int winningPlayerCount(int n, vector<vector<int>>& pick) {
        vector<map<int, int>> freq(n);

        for (auto& p : pick)
            ++ freq[p[0]][p[1]];

        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int ma = 0;

            for (auto [c, b] : freq[i])
                ma = max(ma, b);

            if (ma > i)
                ++ ans;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
