# Medium

Given a parentheses string $s$ containing only the characters **'('** and **')'**. A parentheses string is balanced if:

- Any left parenthesis **'('** must have a corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis **'))'**.
- Left parenthesis **'('** must go before the corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis **'))'**.

In other words, we treat **'('** as an opening parenthesis and **'))'** as a closing parenthesis.

You can insert the characters **'('** and **')'** at any position of the string to balance it if needed.

Return the minimum number of insertions needed to make $s$ balanced.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minInsertions(string s) {
        int open = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < s.size() - 1)
        {
            // if it is a 'open', good.
            if (s[i] == '(')
                ++ open;
            // if it is a 'close', 
            else
            {
                // and if the next char is also a 'close', 
                if (s[i + 1] == ')')
                {
                    // if we have some 'open' in the stack, good, we have a valid pattern.
                    if (open)
