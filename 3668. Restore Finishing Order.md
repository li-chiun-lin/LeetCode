# Easy

You are given an integer array $order$ of length $n$ and an integer array $friends$.

- $order$ contains every integer from $1$ to $n$ exactly once, representing the IDs of the participants of a race in their finishing order.
- $friends$ contains the IDs of your friends in the race sorted in strictly increasing order. Each ID in friends is guaranteed to appear in the $order$ array.

Return an array containing your friends' IDs in their finishing order.

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    vector<int> recoverOrder(vector<int>& order, vector<int>& friends)
    {
        // Store all friends in a set for fast lookup (O(1) average case per check).
        set<int> friendSet(friends.begin(), friends.end());

        // Result vector to store recovered order
        vector<int> recovered;

        // Traverse the given order
        for (int person : order)
        {
            // If this person is in the friend set, keep them
            if (friendSet.count(person))
                recovered.push_back(person);
        }

        return recovered;  // Return the filtered sequence
    }
};
```
