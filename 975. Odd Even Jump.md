# Hard

You are given an integer array $arr$. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.

You may jump forward from index $i$ to index $j$ (with $i < j$) in the following way:

- During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index $j$ such that $arr[i] \leq arr[j]$ and $arr[j]$ is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices $j$, you can only jump to the smallest such index $j$.
- During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index $j$ such that $arr[i] \leq arr[j]$ and $arr[j]$ is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices $j$, you can only jump to the smallest such index $j$.
- It may be the case that for some index $i$, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index $arr.length - 1$) by jumping some number of times (possibly $0$ or more than once).

Return the number of good starting indices.
