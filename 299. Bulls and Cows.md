You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number $secret$ and your friend's guess $guess$, return the hint for your friend's guess.

The hint should be formatted as **"xAyB"**, where $x$ is the number of bulls and $y$ is the number of cows. Note that both $secret$ and $guess$ may contain duplicate digits.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string getHint(string secret, string guess) {
        map<char, int> hit;
        
        for (char c : secret)
            ++ hit[c];
        
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < secret.size(); ++i)
        {
            if (secret[i] == guess[i])
            {
                ++ x;
                -- hit[guess[i]];
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < secret.size(); ++i)
        {
            if (secret[i] != guess[i] && hit[guess[i]])
            {
                ++ y;
                -- hit[guess[i]];
            }
        }
        
        return to_string(x) + 'A' + to_string(y) + 'B';
    }
};
```
