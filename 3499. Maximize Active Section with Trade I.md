# Medium

You are given a binary string $s$ of length $n$, where:

- '1' represents an active section.
- '0' represents an inactive section.

You can perform at most one trade to maximize the number of active sections in $s$. In a trade, you:

- Convert a contiguous block of '1's that is surrounded by '0's to all '0's.
- Afterward, convert a contiguous block of '0's that is surrounded by '1's to all '1's.

Return the maximum number of active sections in $s$ after making the optimal trade.

Note: Treat $s$ as if it is augmented with a '1' at both ends, forming $t$ = '1' + $s$ + '1'. The augmented '1's do not contribute to the final count.

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    int maxActiveSectionsAfterTrade(string s)
    {
        // Pad the string with '1' at both ends to simplify boundary conditions
        string t = "1" + s + "1";

        int n = t.size(); // Total length of the modified string
        int i = 0, oneCount = 0, zeroCount = 0;
        int currentZeroSeq = 0, previousZeroSeq = 0;

        // Count leading '1's
        while (i < n && t[i] == '1') 
        {
            oneCount++;
            i++;
        }
        
        // Count the first sequence of '0's
        while (i < n && t[i] == '0') 
        {
            previousZeroSeq++;
            i++;
        }

        // Process remaining parts of the string
        while (i < n)
        {
            // Count sequence of '1's
            while (i < n && t[i] == '1') 
            {
                oneCount++;
                i++;
            }
            
            if (i == n) // Break if end of string is reached
                break;
            
            // Count the next sequence of '0's
            while (i < n && t[i] == '0') 
            {
                currentZeroSeq++;
                i++;
            }
            
            // Update maximum zero sequence sum
            zeroCount = max(zeroCount, previousZeroSeq + currentZeroSeq);
            
            // Shift the zero sequences
            previousZeroSeq = currentZeroSeq;
            currentZeroSeq = 0;
        }
        
        // The total maximum active sections = (number of '1's) + (max zero sum) - 2 (due to padding)
        return oneCount + zeroCount - 2;
    }
};
