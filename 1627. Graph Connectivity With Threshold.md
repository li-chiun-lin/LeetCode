# Hard

We have $n$ cities labeled from $1$ to $n$. Two different cities with labels $x$ and $y$ are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if $x$ and $y$ share a common divisor strictly greater than some $threshold$. More formally, cities with labels $x$ and $y$ have a road between them if there exists an integer $z$ such that all of the following are true:

- $x \mod z == 0$,
- $y \mod z == 0$, and
- $z > threshold$.

Given the two integers, $n$ and $threshold$, and an array of $queries$, you must determine for each $queries[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ if cities $a_i$ and $b_i$ are connected directly or indirectly.

Return an array $answer$, where $answer.length == queries.length$ and $answer[i]$ is $true$ if for the $ith query, there is a path between $a_i$ and $b_i$, or $answer[i]$ is $false$ if there is no path.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> areConnected(int n, int threshold, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<bool> ans;
        vector<int> grp(n + 1);
        iota(begin(grp), end(grp), 0);

        function<int(int)> find = [&](int x) -> int
        {
            return x == grp[x] ? x : grp[x] = find(grp[x]);
        };

        auto join = [&](int x, int y) -> void
        {
            int gx = find(x);
            int gy = find(y);

            if (gx != gy)
                grp[gx] = gy;
        };

        for (int d = threshold + 1; d <= n; ++d)
            for (int i = d * 2; i <= n; i += d)
                join(d, i);

        for (auto& q : queries)
            ans.push_back(find(q[0]) == find(q[1]));

        return ans;
    }
};
```
