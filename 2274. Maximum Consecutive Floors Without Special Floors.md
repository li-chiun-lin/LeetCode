Alice manages a company and has rented some floors of a building as office space. Alice has decided some of these floors should be special floors, used for relaxation only.

You are given two integers **bottom** and **top**, which denote that Alice has rented all the floors from **bottom** to **top** (inclusive). You are also given the integer array **special**, where **special[i]** denotes a special floor that Alice has designated for relaxation.

Return the maximum number of consecutive floors without a special floor.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxConsecutive(int bottom, int top, vector<int>& special) {
        // might not be necessary, just in case that special[] are not provided sorted.
        sort(special.begin(), special.end());
        
        // the first consecutive floor between bottom and the first special floor and
        // the last that between the last special floor and the top.
        int ret = max(special[0] - bottom, top - special.back());
        
        // the rest of the special floors
        for (int i = 1; i < special.size(); ++i)
            ret = max(ret, special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
