# Medium

You are given an integer array $heights$ representing the heights of buildings, some $bricks$, and some $ladders$.

You start your journey from building $0$ and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building $i$ to building $i+1$ (0-indexed),

- If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
- If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or $(h[i+1] - h[i])$ bricks.

Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int furthestBuilding(vector<int>& heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
        int n = heights.size();
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<>> pq;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < n - 1)
        {
            if (heights[i] >= heights[i + 1])
                ;
            else
            {
                int diff = heights[i + 1] - heights[i];
                
                // use ladders first
                if (pq.size() < ladders)
                    pq.push(diff);
                else
                {
                    // swap some bricks for a used ladder, so that the ladder can be used more efficiently in the future.
                    if (pq.size() && diff > pq.top() && bricks >= pq.top())
                    {
                        bricks -= pq.top();
                        pq.pop();
                        pq.push(diff);
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        if (bricks >= diff)
                            bricks -= diff;
                        else
                            return i;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            ++ i;
        }
        
        return i;
    }
};
