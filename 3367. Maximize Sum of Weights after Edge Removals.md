# Hard

There exists an undirected tree with $n$ nodes numbered $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$ with weight $w_i$ in the tree.

Your task is to remove zero or more edges such that:

- Each node has an edge with at most $k$ other nodes, where $k$ is given.
- The sum of the weights of the remaining edges is maximized.

Return the maximum possible sum of weights for the remaining edges after making the necessary removals.

class Solution {
    void dfs(vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& adj, int u, int parent, int k, vector<vector<long long>>& dp) {
        vector<long long> differences;
        long long sumWeights = 0;

        // Explore all neighbors of the current node
        for (auto [v, w] : adj[u]) {
            if (v == parent) 
                continue;  // Skip the parent node to avoid backtracking

            dfs(adj, v, u, k, dp);  // Recursively process the child node

            // Difference in weight contribution between keeping and removing the edge
            differences.push_back(w + dp[v][1] - dp[v][0]);

            // Accumulate the base case sum (dp[v][0]) for the subtree rooted at v
            sumWeights += dp[v][0];
        }

        // Sort differences in descending order to prioritize edges with higher contributions
