You are given a binary string $s$. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

- Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string $s$ and append it to the end of the string.
- Type-2: Pick any character in $s$ and flip its value.

Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that $s$ becomes alternating.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(string s) {
        int n = size(s);
        int ans = n;
        int cnt0 = 0, cnt1 = 0;
        char x0 = '0', x1 = '0';

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (s[i] != x0)
                ++ cnt0;
            else
                ++ cnt1;

            x0 ^= 1;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            ans = min(ans, min(cnt0, cnt1));

            if (s[i] != x0)
                ++ cnt0;
            else
                ++ cnt1;

            if (s[i] != x1)
                -- cnt0;
            else
                -- cnt1;

            x0 ^= 1;
            x1 ^= 1;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
