# Easy

You are given a string $s$ formed by digits and **'#'**. We want to map $s$ to English lowercase characters as follows:

- Characters (**'a'** to **'i'**) are represented by (**'1'** to **'9'**) respectively.
- Characters (**'j'** to **'z'**) are represented by (**'10#'** to **'26#'**) respectively.

Return the string formed after mapping.

The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string freqAlphabets(string s) {
        string ret = "";
        int n = s.size();
        int i = n - 1;
        
        while (i >= 0)
        {
            if (s[i] == '#')
            {
                ret += (s[i - 2] - '0') * 10 + s[i - 1] - '0' - 10 + 'j';
                i -= 3;
            }
            else
            {
                ret += s[i] - '0' - 1 + 'a';
                -- i;
            }
        }
        
        reverse(ret.begin(), ret.end());
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
