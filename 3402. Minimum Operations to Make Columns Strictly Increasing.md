# Easy

You are given a $m \times n$ matrix $grid$ consisting of non-negative integers.

In one operation, you can increment the value of any $grid[i][j]$ by $1$.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all columns of $grid$ strictly increasing.

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid)
    {
        int operations = 0; // Initialize the count of operations

        // Traverse each column of the grid
        for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].size(); ++col)
        {
            int maxVal = grid[0][col]; // Start with the first element in the column

            // Process each subsequent row in the column
            for (int row = 1; row < grid.size(); ++row)
            {
                // Update the value to maintain the non-decreasing order
                maxVal = max(maxVal + 1, grid[row][col]);

                // Count the number of operations needed
                operations += maxVal - grid[row][col];
            }
        }

        return operations; // Return the total operations needed
    }
};
```
