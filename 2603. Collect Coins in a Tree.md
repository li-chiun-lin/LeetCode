# Hard

There exists an undirected and unrooted tree with $n$ nodes indexed from $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given an integer $n$ and a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree. You are also given an array $coins$ of size $n$ where $coins[i]$ can be either $0$ or $1$, where $1$ indicates the presence of a coin in the vertex $i$.

Initially, you choose to start at any vertex in the tree. Then, you can perform the following operations any number of times:

- Collect all the coins that are at a distance of at most $2$ from the current vertex, or
- Move to any adjacent vertex in the tree.

Find the minimum number of edges you need to go through to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex.

Note that if you pass an edge several times, you need to count it into the answer several times.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int collectTheCoins(vector<int>& coins, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = coins.size();

        // build adjacent list
        vector<set<int>> adj(n);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].insert(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].insert(e[0]);
        }

        // trim leaves without coins
        queue<int> que;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (adj[i].size() == 1 && coins[i] == 0)
                que.push(i);

        while (que.size())
        {
            auto u = que.front();
            que.pop();

            auto v = *begin(adj[u]);
            adj[v].erase(u);
            adj[u].erase(v);

            if (adj[v].size() == 1 && coins[v] == 0)
                que.push(v);
        }

        // trim levaves with coins, 
        // do this twice.
        for (int c = 0; c < 2; ++c)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
                if (adj[i].size() == 1 && coins[i] != 0)
                    que.push(i);

            while (que.size())
            {
                auto u = que.front();
                que.pop();

                auto v = *begin(adj[u]);
                adj[v].erase(u);
                adj[u].erase(v);
                coins[v] += coins[u];
                coins[u] = 0;
            }
        }

        // count the surviving nodes.
        int cnt = 0;

        for (auto& a : adj)
            if (a.size() != 0)
                ++ cnt;

        return cnt == 0 ? 0 : (cnt - 1) * 2;
    }
};
```
