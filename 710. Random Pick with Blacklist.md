# Hard

You are given an integer $n$ and an array of unique integers $blacklist$. Design an algorithm to pick a random integer in the range [0, n - 1] that is not in $blacklist$. Any integer that is in the mentioned range and not in $blacklist$ should be equally likely to be returned.

Optimize your algorithm such that it minimizes the number of calls to the built-in random function of your language.

Implement the $Solution$ class:

- $Solution(int n, int[] blacklist)$ Initializes the object with the integer $n$ and the blacklisted integers $blacklist$.
- $int pick()$ Returns a random integer in the range $[0, n - 1]$ and not in $blacklist$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    map<int, int> mp;
    int m;
public:
    Solution(int n, vector<int>& blacklist) {
        for (int b : blacklist)
            mp[b] = -1;

        m = n - mp.size();
        
        for (int b : blacklist)
        {
            if (b < m)
            {
                while (mp.count(n - 1))
                    -- n;
                
                mp[b] = -- n;
            }
        }
    }
    
    int pick() {
        int r = rand() % m;
        return mp.count(r) ? mp[r] : r;
    }
};
```
