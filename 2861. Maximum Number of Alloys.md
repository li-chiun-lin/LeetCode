You are the owner of a company that creates alloys using various types of metals. There are $n$ different types of metals available, and you have access to $k$ machines that can be used to create alloys. Each machine requires a specific amount of each metal type to create an alloy.

For the $i$-th machine to create an alloy, it needs $composition[i][j]$ units of metal of type $j$. Initially, you have $stock[i]$ units of metal type $i$, and purchasing one unit of metal type $i$ costs $cost[i]$ coins.

Given integers $n$, $k$, $budget$, a 1-indexed 2D array $composition$, and 1-indexed arrays $stock$ and $cost$, your goal is to maximize the number of alloys the company can create while staying within the budget of $budget$ coins.

All alloys must be created with the same machine.

Return the maximum number of alloys that the company can create.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfAlloys(int n, int k, int budget, vector<vector<int>>& composition, vector<int>& stock, vector<int>& cost) {
        function<bool(long long)> check = [&] (long long cnt)
        {
            long long ret = INT_MAX;

            for (auto& c : composition)
            {
                long long purchase = 0;

                for (int j = 0; j < size(c); ++j)
                    purchase += max(cnt * c[j] - stock[j], 0LL) * cost[j];

                ret = min(ret, purchase);
            }

            return ret <= budget;
        };

        long long l = 0, r = 1e9, ans = 0;

        while (l <= r)
        {
            long long m = l + (r - l) / 2;

            if (check(m))
            {
                ans = m;
                l = m + 1;
            }
            else
                r = m - 1;
        }

        return ans;
    }
