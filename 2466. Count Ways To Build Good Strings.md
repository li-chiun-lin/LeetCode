Given the integers $zero$, $one$, $low$, and $high$, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

- Append the character '0' $zero$ times.
- Append the character '1' $one$ times.

This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between $low$ and $high$ (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    long long dfs(int l, int h, int z, int o, int len, vector<long long>& dp)
    {
        if (len > h)
            return 0;
        
        if (len == h)
            return 1;
        
        if (dp[len] != -1)
            return dp[len];
        
        int c = len >= l;
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        
        return dp[len] = (dfs(l, h, z, o, len + z, dp) + dfs(l, h, z, o, len + o, dp) + c) % mod;
    }
public:
    int countGoodStrings(int low, int high, int zero, int one) {
        vector<long long> dp(high, -1);
        
        return dfs(low, high, zero, one, 0, dp);
    }
};
```
