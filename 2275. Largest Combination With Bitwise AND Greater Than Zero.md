The bitwise AND of an array **nums** is the bitwise AND of all integers in **nums**.

You are given an array of positive integers **candidates**. Evaluate the bitwise AND of every combination of numbers of **candidates**. Each number in **candidates** may only be used once in each combination.

Return the size of the largest combination of **candidates** with a bitwise AND greater than **0**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestCombination(vector<int>& candidates) {
        vector<int> unset(32);
        int n = candidates.size();
        
        // When talking about bitwise AND, we have to bear in mind that this operation can only reduce the value.
        // For any two arbitary integer A and B, we have (A AND B) <= min(A, B).
        // So, for each candidates, we care more about its unset bits then it set bits,
        // Since as long as there is even one unset bit at any position, the corresponding bit in the final AND result will be unset.
        // 
        // On the other hand, 
        // if we can make sure that at least one position that can never have unset bit within all the candidates in a combination,
        // we are sure that the final AND result will never be zero since there is at least one set bit, 
        // we don't have to actually apply the AND operation on every combination.
        //
        // Hence, here is our solution goes:
        // 1. Iterate through each candidates and count how many of them have unset bits at each possible positions i.
        // 2. Find the position that have minimal candidates that have unset bits in that position, 
        //    this is the set of candidates that we 'DO NOT' want to include in result combination,
        //    so to avoid unset this very precious bit in the AND result.
        // 3. The rest of the candidates can all be feed to the AND and the result should never be zero, 
        //    since we have rule out the minimal candidates that could otherwise unset our precious bit,
        //    the result combination is largest.
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i)
        {
            unsigned int mask = 1 << i;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                if ((mask & candidates[j]) == 0)
                    ++ unset[i];
        }
        
        int mm = *min_element(unset.begin(), unset.end());
        
        return n - mm;
    }
};
```
