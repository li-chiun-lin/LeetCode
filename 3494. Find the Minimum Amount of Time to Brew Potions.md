# Medium

You are given two integer arrays, $skill$ and $mana$, of length $n$ and $m$, respectively.

In a laboratory, $n$ wizards must brew $m$ potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity $mana[j]$ and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the $i$-th wizard on the $j$-th potion is $time_{ij} = skill[i] \times mana[j]$.

Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹

Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minTime(vector<int>& skill, vector<int>& mana) 
    {
        int numSkills = skill.size();
        int numManaValues = mana.size();
        vector<long long> dp(numSkills + 1, 0); // dp[i] stores max time for first `i` skills

        // Iterate over all mana values
        for (int j = 0; j < numManaValues; ++j) 
        {
            // Forward update: Compute the maximum possible time considering the current mana
            for (int i = 0; i < numSkills; ++i)
            {
                dp[i + 1] = max(dp[i + 1], dp[i]) + skill[i] * mana[j];
            }

            // Backward update: Adjust values to ensure minimum time calculation
            for (int i = numSkills - 1; i > 0; --i)
            {
                dp[i] = dp[i + 1] - skill[i] * mana[j];
            }
        }

        return dp.back(); // Return the maximum time needed for all skills
    }
};
```
