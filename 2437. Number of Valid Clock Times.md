# Easy

You are given a string of length $5$ called $time$, representing the current time on a digital clock in the format **"hh:mm"**. The earliest possible time is **"00:00"** and the latest possible time is **"23:59"**.

In the string $time$, the digits represented by the **?** symbol are unknown, and must be replaced with a digit from $0$ to $9$.

Return an integer $answer$, the number of valid clock times that can be created by replacing every **?** with a digit from $0$ to $9$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTime(string time) {
        int ret = 1;
        
        // hh == '??'
        if (time[0] == '?' && time[1] == '?')
            ret = 24;
        else if (time[0] == '?')
        {
            if ('0' <= time[1] && time[1] <= '3')
                ret = 3;
            else
                ret = 2;
        }
        else if (time[1] == '?')
        {
            if (time[0] == '0' || time[0] == '1')
                ret = 10;
            else
                ret = 4;
        }
        
        // mm
        if (time[3] == '?')
            ret *= 6;
        
        if (time[4] == '?')
            ret *= 10;
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
