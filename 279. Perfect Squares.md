# Medium

Given an integer $n$, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to $n$.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSquares(int n) {
        vector<unsigned int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);
        
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            for (int j = 1, jj = 1; jj <= i; ++j, jj = j * j)
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - jj] + 1);
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
