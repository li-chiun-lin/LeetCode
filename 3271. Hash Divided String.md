You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ and an integer $k$, where $n$ is a multiple of $k$. Your task is to hash the string $s$ into a new string called $result$, which has a length of $n / k$.

First, divide $s$ into $n / k$ substrings , each with a length of $k$. Then, initialize $result$ as an empty string.

For each substring in order from the beginning:

- The hash value of a character is the index of that character in the English alphabet (e.g., 'a' → 0, 'b' → 1, ..., 'z' → 25).
- Calculate the sum of all the hash values of the characters in the substring.
- Find the remainder of this sum when divided by 26, which is called $hashedChar$.
- Identify the character in the English lowercase alphabet that corresponds to $hashedChar$.
- Append that character to the end of $result$.

Return $result$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string stringHash(string s, int k) {
        string result = "";
        int n = size(s);
        int m = n / k;
        int idx = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        {
            int v = 0;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j)
                v += s[idx ++] - 'a';
            
            result.push_back((v % 26) + 'a');
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
