# Hard

You are given three integers $n$, $x$, and $y$.

An event is being held for $n$ performers. When a performer arrives, they are assigned to one of the $x$ stages. All performers assigned to the same stage will perform together as a band, though some stages might remain empty.

After all performances are completed, the jury will award each band a score in the range $[1, y]$.

Return the total number of possible ways the event can take place.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWays(int n, int x, int y) {
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        int ub = max(n, x);
        int lb = min(n, x);
        vector<vector<long long>> dp(ub + 1, vector<long long>(ub + 1));

        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= ub; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j)
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j] * j) % mod; 

        long long ans = 0;
        long long perm = 1;
        long long p = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= lb; ++i)
        {
            perm = perm * (x - i + 1) % mod;
            p = p * y % mod;
            ans = (ans + perm * dp[n][i] % mod * p) % mod;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
