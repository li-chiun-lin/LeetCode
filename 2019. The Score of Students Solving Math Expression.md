# Hard

You are given a string $s$ that contains digits $0-9$, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '\*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers. This expression was given to $n$ elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this order of operations:

1. Compute multiplication, reading from left to right; Then,
1. Compute addition, reading from left to right.

You are given an integer array $answers$ of length $n$, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the $answers$, by following these rules:

- If an answer equals the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded $5$ points;
- Otherwise, if the answer could be interpreted as if the student applied the operators in the wrong order but had correct arithmetic, this student will be rewarded $2$ points;
- Otherwise, this student will be rewarded $0$ points.

Return the sum of the points of the students.
