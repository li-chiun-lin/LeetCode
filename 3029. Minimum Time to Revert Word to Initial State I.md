You are given a 0-indexed string $word$ and an integer $k$.

At every second, you must perform the following operations:

- Remove the first $k$ characters of $word$.
- Add any $k$ characters to the end of $word$.

Note that you do not necessarily need to add the same characters that you removed. However, you must perform both operations at every second.

Return the minimum time greater than zero required for $word$ to revert to its initial state.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTimeToInitialState(string word, int k) {
        int cnt = 1;
        int n = size(word);
        
        auto check = [&](int offset)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i + offset < n; ++i)
                if (word[i] != word[i + offset])
                    return false;
            
            return true;
        };
        
        for (int offset = k; ! check(offset); offset += k)
            ++ cnt;
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
