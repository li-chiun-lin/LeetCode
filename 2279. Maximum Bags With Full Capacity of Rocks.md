# Medium

You have $n$ bags numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays $capacity$ and $rocks$. The $i$-th bag can hold a maximum of $capacity[i]$ rocks and currently contains $rocks[i]$ rocks. You are also given an integer $additionalRocks$, the number of additional rocks you can place in any of the bags.

Return the maximum number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumBags(vector<int>& capacity, vector<int>& rocks, int additionalRocks) {
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<> > pq;
        int n = capacity.size();
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            pq.push(capacity[i] - rocks[i]);
        
        while (pq.size() && pq.top() <= additionalRocks)
        {
            additionalRocks -= pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            ++ cnt;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
