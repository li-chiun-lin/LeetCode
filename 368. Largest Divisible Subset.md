Given a set of distinct positive integers $nums$, return the largest subset $answer$ such that every pair $(answer[i], answer[j])$ of elements in this subset satisfies:

- $answer[i] \mod answer[j] == 0$, or
- $answer[j] \mod answer[i] == 0$

If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

```cpp
class Solution {

    /*
    An efficient solution involves following steps.

    1. Sort all array elements in increasing order. The purpose of sorting is to make sure that all divisors of an element appear before it.
    2. Create an array dp[] of same size as input array. dp[i] stores size of divisible subset ending with arr[i] (In sorted array). The minimum value of dp[i] would be 1.
    3. Traverse all array elements. For every element, find a divisor arr[j] with largest value of dp[j] and store the value of dp[i] as dp[j] + 1.
