# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed string array **words**, where **words[i]** consists of lowercase English letters.

In one operation, select any index **i** such that **0 < i < words.length** and **words[i - 1]** and **words[i]** are anagrams, and delete **words[i]** from **words**. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.

Return **words** after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, **"dacb"** is an anagram of **"abdc"**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeAnagrams(vector<string>& words) {
        string pre = "";
        string cur = "";
        vector<string> ret;
        
        // How do we compare two words to see where there are anagrams or not?
        // Count the frequency is one way, but here, we use a strategy that might be called
        // "copy, sort, then compare".
        // the "copy" is essential or otherwise we will mess up the words[] and then inevitably have no way to form the required result.
        
        // copy 
        pre = words[0];
        // sort
        sort(pre.begin(), pre.end());
        // the very first word will alway survive.
        ret.push_back(words[0]);
        
        // for the rest words
        for (int i = 1; i < words.size(); ++i)
        {
            // copy
            cur = words[i];
            // sort
            sort(cur.begin(), cur.end());
            // then compare
            if (pre != cur)
            {
                pre = cur;
                ret.push_back(words[i]);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
