You are given an integer array $arr$ of length $n$ that represents a permutation of the integers in the range $[0, n - 1]$.

We split $arr$ into some number of chunks (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int cnt = 0;
        int expect = 0;
        int current = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            expect |= 1 << i;
            current |= 1 << arr[i];
            
            if (expect == current)
            {
                ++ cnt;
                expect = 0;
                current = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
