You are given two integers, $n$ and $threshold$, as well as a directed weighted graph of $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. The graph is represented by a 2D integer array $edges$, where $edges[i] = [A_i, B_i, W_i]$ indicates that there is an edge going from node $A_i$ to node $B_i$ with weight $W_i$.

You have to remove some edges from this graph (possibly none), so that it satisfies the following conditions:

- Node $0$ must be reachable from all other nodes.
- The maximum edge weight in the resulting graph is minimized.
- Each node has at most $threshold$ outgoing edges.

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum edge weight after removing the necessary edges. If it is impossible for all conditions to be satisfied, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMaxWeight(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int threshold) {
        // Build the adjacency list
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[1]].emplace_back(edge[0], edge[2]);
        }

        // Distance array to store the minimum maximum weight to each node
        vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX);

        // Min-heap priority queue to process nodes in order of their weights
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> pq;

        // Start from node 0 with initial weight 0
        pq.emplace(0, 0);

        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [currentWeight, currentNode] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            // Update the minimum maximum weight to reach currentNode
            if (currentWeight >= distance[currentNode]) {
                continue; // Skip if this path is not better
            }
            distance[currentNode] = currentWeight;

            // Process neighbors
            for (const auto& [neighbor, edgeWeight] : adj[currentNode]) {
                int newWeight = max(currentWeight, edgeWeight);
                if (distance[neighbor] > newWeight) {
                    pq.emplace(newWeight, neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        // Find the maximum of the minimum maximum weights across all nodes
        int result = *max_element(distance.begin(), distance.end());

        // If any node is unreachable, return -1
        return result == INT_MAX ? -1 : result;
    }
};
