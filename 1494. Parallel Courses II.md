# Hard

You are given an integer $n$, which indicates that there are $n$ courses labeled from $1$ to $n$. You are also given an array $relations$ where $relations[i] = [prevCourse_i, nextCourse_i]$, representing a prerequisite relationship between course $prevCourse_i$ and course $nextCourse_i$: course $prevCourse_i$ has to be taken before course $nextCourse_i$. Also, you are given the integer $k$.

In one semester, you can take at most $k$ courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the previous semesters for the courses you are taking.

Return the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses. The testcases will be generated such that it is possible to take every course.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOfSemesters(int n, vector<vector<int>>& relations, int k) {
        vector<int> prerequisite(n);

        for (auto& r : relations)
            prerequisite[r[1] - 1] |= 1 << (r[0] - 1);

        int ub = 1 << n;
        vector<int> set_of_prerequisite(ub);

        for (int course_of_a_semester = 0; course_of_a_semester < ub; ++course_of_a_semester)
            for (int course = 0; course < n; ++course)
                if (course_of_a_semester & (1 << course))
                    set_of_prerequisite[course_of_a_semester] |= prerequisite[course];

        vector<int> dp(ub, n + 1);
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < ub; ++i)
            for (int j = i; j; j = (j - 1) & i)
                if (__builtin_popcount(j) <= k && 
                    ((i ^ (ub - 1)) & set_of_prerequisite[j]) == set_of_prerequisite[j])
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i ^ j] + 1);

        return dp.back();
    }
};
