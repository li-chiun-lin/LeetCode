You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers $start$ and $end$ that represents a booking on the half-open interval $[start, end)$, the range of real numbers $x$ such that $start \leq x < end$.

Implement the __MyCalendarTwo__ class:

- __MyCalendarTwo()__ Initializes the calendar object.
- __boolean book(int start, int end)__ Returns $true$ if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return $false$ and do not add the event to the calendar.

```cpp
class MyCalendarTwo {
    map<int, int> sweep;

public:
    MyCalendarTwo() {
        
    }
    
    bool book(int start, int end) {
        ++ sweep[start];
        -- sweep[end];

        int accu = 0;

        for (auto [k, v] : sweep)
        {
            accu += v;

            if (accu > 2)
            {
                if (-- sweep[start] == 0)
                    sweep.erase(start);

                if (++ sweep[end] == 0)
                    sweep.erase(end);

                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```
