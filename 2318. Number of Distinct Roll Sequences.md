# Hard

You are given an integer $n$. You roll a fair 6-sided dice $n$ times. Determine the total number of distinct sequences of rolls possible such that the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The greatest common divisor of any adjacent values in the sequence is equal to $1$.
1. There is at least a gap of $2$ rolls between equal valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the $i$-th roll is equal to the value of the $j$-th roll, then $abs(i - j) > 2$.

Return the total number of distinct sequences possible. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distinctSequences(int n) {
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<vector<long long>>> dp(n + 1, 
            vector<vector<long long>>(7, 
            vector<long long>(7)));

        function<long long(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int i, int p, int pp) -> long long
        {
            if (i == 0)
                return 1;

            if (dp[i][p][pp])
                return dp[i][p][pp];

            for (int d = 1; d <= 6; ++d)
                if (d != p && d != pp && (p == 0 || gcd(d, p) == 1))
                    dp[i][p][pp] = (dp[i][p][pp] + dfs(i - 1, d, p)) % m;

            return dp[i][p][pp];
        };

        return dfs(n, 0, 0);
    }
};
```
