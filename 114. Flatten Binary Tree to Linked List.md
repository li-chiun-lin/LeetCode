Given the $root$ of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same **TreeNode** class where the $right$ child pointer points to the next node in the list and the $left$ child pointer is always $null$.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        if (! root)
            return;

        if (root->left)
        {
            auto ptr = root->left;

            while (ptr && ptr->right)
                ptr = ptr->right;

            ptr ->right = root->right;
            root->right = root->left;
            root->left = NULL;
        }

        flatten(root->right);
    }
};
```
