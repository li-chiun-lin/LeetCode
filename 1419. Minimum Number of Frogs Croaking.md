# Medium

You are given the string $croakOfFrogs$, which represents a combination of the string **"croak"** from different frogs, that is, multiple frogs can croak at the same time, so multiple **"croak"** are mixed.

Return the minimum number of different frogs to finish all the croaks in the given string.

A valid **"croak"** means a frog is printing five letters **'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', and 'k'** sequentially. The frogs have to print all five letters to finish a croak. If the given string is not a combination of a valid **"croak"** return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOfFrogs(string croakOfFrogs) {
        int ret = 0;
        string seq = "croak";
        map<char, int> hit;
        map<char, int> idx;
        
        // for convenience
        for (int i = 0; i < seq.size(); ++i)
            idx[seq[i]] = i;
        
        for (char c : croakOfFrogs)
        {
            ++ hit[c];
            
            // the is the core idea: the maximum frogs singing simultaneously
            ret = max(ret, hit[c]);
            
            // the frequency of any symbol comes before, must be larger or equal to
            // the frequency of the current symbol, 
            // or otherwise it means some frogs must singing something other than "croak", 
            // which is bad.
            for (int i = idx[c] - 1; i >= 0; --i)
                if (hit[seq[i]] < hit[c])
                    return -1;
            
            // this symbol ends a "croak", which mean a frog is free for next "croak"
            if (c == 'k')
                for (char d : seq)
                    -- hit[d];
        }
        
        // any unfinished "croak" is illegal
        for (char d : seq)
            if (hit[d])
                return -1;
        
        return ret;
    }
};
