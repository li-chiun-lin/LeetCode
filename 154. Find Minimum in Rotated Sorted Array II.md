# Hard

Suppose an array of length $n$ sorted in ascending order is rotated between $1$ and $n$ times.

Notice that rotating an array $[a[0], a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n-1]]$ 1 time results in the array $[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n-2]]$.

Given the sorted rotated array $nums$ that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.size() - 1;
        int m = 0;
        
        while (l < r)
        {
            m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            
            if (nums[m] > nums[r])
                l = m + 1;
            else if (nums[m] < nums[r])
                r = m;
            else
                -- r;
        }
        
        return nums[l];
    }
};
```
