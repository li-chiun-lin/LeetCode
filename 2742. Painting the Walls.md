# Hard

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, $cost$ and $time$, of size $n$ representing the costs and the time taken to paint $n$ different walls respectively. There are two painters available:

- A paid painter that paints the $i$-th wall in $time[i]$ units of time and takes $cost[i]$ units of money.
- A free painter that paints any wall in $1$ unit of time at a cost of $0$. But the free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already occupied.

Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the $n$ walls

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(vector<int>& cost, vector<int>& time, int i, int r, vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        // good end case: every wall is painted.
        if (r <= 0)
            return 0;

        // bad end case: there are no more time slots.
        if (i < 0)
            return 1e9;

        if (dp[i][r])
            return dp[i][r];

        // case 1: we dont let paid painter paint this wall, 
        int dont = dfs(cost, time, i - 1, r, dp);

        // case 2: we do let paid painter paint this wall, 
        //      the paid painter will paint 1 wall
        //      the free painter will paint time[i] walls
        int take = dfs(cost, time, i - 1, r - time[i] - 1, dp) + cost[i];

        return dp[i][r] = min(take, dont);
    }

public:
    int paintWalls(vector<int>& cost, vector<int>& time) {
        int n = cost.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n + 1));

        return dfs(cost, time, n - 1, n, dp);
    }
};
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int paintWalls(vector<int>& cost, vector<int>& time) {
        int n = cost.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 1e9));

        dp[0][0] = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            dp[i + 1][0] = 0;

            for (int r = 1; r <= n; ++r)
                dp[i + 1][r] = min(dp[i][r], dp[i][max(r - time[i] - 1, 0)] + cost[i]);
        }

        return dp[n][n];
    }
};
```
