# Medium

Given $n$ points on a 1-D plane, where the $i$-th point (from $0$ to $n-1$) is at $x = i$, find the number of ways we can draw exactly $k$ non-overlapping line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have integral coordinates. The $k$ line segments do not have to cover all $n$ points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.

Return the number of ways we can draw $k$ non-overlapping line segments. Since this number can be huge, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSets(int n, int k) {
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n, 
            vector<vector<int>>(k + 1, 
            vector<int>(2, -1)));
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;

        function<int(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int i, int k, int cont) -> int
        {
            if (k == 0)
                return 1;
            
            if (i == n)
                return 0;

            if (dp[i][k][cont] != -1)
                return dp[i][k][cont];

            int ans = dfs(i + 1, k, cont);

            if (cont)
                ans += dfs(i + 1, k, 0);
            else
                ans += dfs(i, k - 1, 1);

            return dp[i][k][cont] = ans % mod;
        };

        return dfs(0, k, 1);
    }
};
```
