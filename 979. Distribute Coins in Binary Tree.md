# Medium

You are given the $root$ of a binary tree with $n$ nodes where each $node$ in the tree has $node.val$ coins. There are $n$ coins in total throughout the whole tree.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int& ret)
    {
        if (! node)
            return 0;
        
        int l = dfs(node->left, ret);
        int r = dfs(node->right, ret);
        
        ret += abs(l) + abs(r);
        
        return node->val + l + r - 1;
    }
public:
    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        int ret = 0;
        
        dfs(root, ret);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
