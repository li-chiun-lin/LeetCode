You are given an integer $n$ representing the number of houses on a number line, numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$.

Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array $offers$ where $offers[i] = [start_i, end_i, gold_i]$, indicating that $i$-th buyer wants to buy all the houses from $start_i$ to $end_i$ for $gold_i$ amount of gold.

As a salesman, your goal is to maximize your earnings by strategically selecting and selling houses to buyers.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can earn.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeTheProfit(int n, vector<vector<int>>& offers) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> m(n);

        for (auto& a : offers)
            m[a[1]].push_back({a[0], a[2]});

        for (int end = 1; end <= n; ++end)
        {
            dp[end] = dp[end - 1];

            for (auto [start, gold] : m[end - 1])
                dp[end] = max(dp[end], dp[start] + gold);
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
