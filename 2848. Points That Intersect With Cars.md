# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $nums$ representing the coordinates of the cars parking on a number line. For any index $i$, $nums[i] = [start_i, end_i]$ where $start_i$ is the starting point of the $i$-th car and $end_i$ is the ending point of the $i$-th car.

Return the number of integer points on the line that are covered with any part of a car.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfPoints(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        vector<int> sweeping(102);

        for (auto& x : nums)
        {
            ++ sweeping[x[0]];
            -- sweeping[x[1] + 1];
        }

        int cnt = 0;
        int acc = 0;

        for (auto x : sweeping)
        {
            acc += x;
            if (acc > 0)
                ++ cnt;
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
```
