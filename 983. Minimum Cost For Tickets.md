# Medium

You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array $days$. Each day is an integer from $1$ to $365$.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:

- a 1-day pass is sold for $costs[0]$ dollars,
- a 7-day pass is sold for $costs[1]$ dollars, and
- a 30-day pass is sold for $costs[2]$ dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(set<int>& ss, vector<int>& costs, int d, vector<int>& dp)
    {
        if (d > 365)
            return 0;
        
        if (dp[d])
            return dp[d];
        
        int ret = INT_MAX;
        
        if (ss.count(d))
        {
            ret = min(ret, dfs(ss, costs, d + 1 , dp) + costs[0]);
            ret = min(ret, dfs(ss, costs, d + 7 , dp) + costs[1]);
            ret = min(ret, dfs(ss, costs, d + 30, dp) + costs[2]);
        }
        else
        {
            ret = dfs(ss, costs, d + 1, dp);
        }
        
        return dp[d] = ret;
    }
public:
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        set<int> ss(begin(days), end(days));
        vector<int> dp(366);
        
        return dfs(ss, costs, 1, dp);
    }
};
```
