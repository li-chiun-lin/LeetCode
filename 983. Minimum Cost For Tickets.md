You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array $days$. Each day is an integer from $1$ to $365$.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:

- a 1-day pass is sold for $costs[0]$ dollars,
- a 7-day pass is sold for $costs[1]$ dollars, and
- a 30-day pass is sold for $costs[2]$ dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

```cpp
class Solution
{
private:
    int dfs(const set<int>& travelDays, const vector<int>& costs, int currentDay, vector<int>& dp)
    {
        if (currentDay > 365)
        {
            return 0;
        }

        if (dp[currentDay] != 0)
        {
            return dp[currentDay];
        }

        int minCost = INT_MAX;

        if (travelDays.count(currentDay))
        {
            // If traveling on the current day, consider all ticket options
            minCost = min(minCost, dfs(travelDays, costs, currentDay + 1, dp) + costs[0]);  // 1-day pass
            minCost = min(minCost, dfs(travelDays, costs, currentDay + 7, dp) + costs[1]);  // 7-day pass
            minCost = min(minCost, dfs(travelDays, costs, currentDay + 30, dp) + costs[2]); // 30-day pass
        }
        else
        {
            // If not traveling on the current day, skip to the next day
            minCost = dfs(travelDays, costs, currentDay + 1, dp);
        }

        dp[currentDay] = minCost;
        return minCost;
    }

public:
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs)
    {
        set<int> travelDays(days.begin(), days.end()); // Days when travel occurs
        vector<int> dp(366, 0);                        // Memoization array for dynamic programming

        return dfs(travelDays, costs, 1, dp);          // Start DFS from day 1
    }
};
```
