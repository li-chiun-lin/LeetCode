# Medium

You are given a non-negative integer $n$ representing a $2^n \times 2^n$ grid. You must fill the grid with integers from 0 to $2^{2^n} - 1$ to make it special. A grid is special if it satisfies all the following conditions:

- All numbers in the top-right quadrant are smaller than those in the bottom-right quadrant.
- All numbers in the bottom-right quadrant are smaller than those in the bottom-left quadrant.
- All numbers in the bottom-left quadrant are smaller than those in the top-left quadrant.
- Each of its quadrants is also a special grid.

Return the special $2^n \times 2^n$ grid.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Recursive function to fill the grid in a specific quadrant order
    void fillGrid(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int row, int col, int size, int& currentVal) {
        // Base case: 1x1 cell, assign value and increment
        if (size == 1) {
            grid[row][col] = currentVal++;
            return;
        }

        int half = size / 2;

        // Recursively fill the quadrants in the specific order:
        // top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left, top-left
        fillGrid(grid, row,         col + half, half, currentVal); // Top-right
        fillGrid(grid, row + half,  col + half, half, currentVal); // Bottom-right
        fillGrid(grid, row + half,  col,        half, currentVal); // Bottom-left
        fillGrid(grid, row,         col,        half, currentVal); // Top-left
    }

public:
    // Returns a 2^N x 2^N grid filled in special quadrant order
    vector<vector<int>> specialGrid(int N) {
        int size = 1 << N; // Equivalent to 2^N
        vector<vector<int>> grid(size, vector<int>(size));
        int startValue = 0;

        fillGrid(grid, 0, 0, size, startValue);

        return grid;
    }
};
```
