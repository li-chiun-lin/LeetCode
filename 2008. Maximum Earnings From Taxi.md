# Medium

There are **n** points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The **n** points on the road are labeled **from 1 to n** in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point **1** to point **n** to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.

The passengers are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array **rides**, where **rides[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, tip<sub>i</sub>]** denotes the **i**-th passenger requesting a ride from point **start<sub>i</sub>** to point **end<sub>i</sub>** who is willing to give a **tip<sub>i</sub>** dollar tip.

For each passenger **i** you pick up, you earn **end<sub>i</sub>** - **start<sub>i</sub>** + **tip<sub>i</sub>** dollars. You may only drive at most one passenger at a time.

Given **n** and rides, return the maximum number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally.

Note: You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxTaxiEarnings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& rides) {
        //Let dp[i] be the maximum dollars we can get if we start at point i.
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> s(n);
        vector<long long> dp(n +1);
        
        for (auto &r : rides)
            s[r[0]].push_back({r[1], r[1] - r[0] + r[2]});
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 1; --i)
        {
            for (auto &[e, t] : s[i])
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[e] + t);
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i + 1]);
        }
        
        return dp[1];
    }
};
```
