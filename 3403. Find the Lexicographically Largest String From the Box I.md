You are given a string $word$, and an integer $numFriends$.

Alice is organizing a game for her $numFriends$ friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:

- $word$ is split into $numFriends$ non-empty strings, such that no previous round has had the exact same split.
- All the split words are put into a box.

Find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished.

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    string answerString(string word, int numFriends)
    {
        int wordLength = word.size();
        int subLength = wordLength - numFriends + 1; // Length of substrings to consider
        string maxSubstring = "";

        // If there's only one "friend," the entire word is the result
        if (numFriends == 1)
        {
            return word;
        }

        // Iterate through the string to find the lexicographically largest substring
        for (int i = 0; i < wordLength; ++i)
        {
            // Calculate the valid length for the substring starting at index `i`
            int currentLength = min(subLength, wordLength - i);
            string currentSubstring = word.substr(i, currentLength);

            // Update the result if the current substring is larger lexicographically
            maxSubstring = max(maxSubstring, currentSubstring);
        }

        return maxSubstring;
    }
};
```
