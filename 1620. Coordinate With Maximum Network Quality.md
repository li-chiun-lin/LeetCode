You are given an array of network towers $towers$, where $towers[i] = [x_i, y_i, q_i]$ denotes the $i$-th network tower with location ($x_i, y_i$) and quality factor $q_i$. All the coordinates are integral coordinates on the X-Y plane, and the distance between the two coordinates is the Euclidean distance.

You are also given an integer $radius$ where a tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to $radius$. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.

The signal quality of the $i$-th tower at a coordinate ($x, y$) is calculated with the formula $⌊q_i / (1 + d)⌋$, where $d$ is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the reachable towers.

Return the array $[c_x, c_y]$ representing the integral coordinate ($c_x, c_y$) where the network quality is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, return the lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> bestCoordinate(vector<vector<int>>& towers, int radius) {
        map<pair<int, int>, int> quality;
        int r2 = radius * radius;
        
        // for each tower
        for (auto &t : towers)
        {
            // for every coordinate within radius, 
            for (int i = -radius; i <= radius; ++i)
                for (int j = -radius; j <= radius; ++j)
                {
                    int d2 = pow(i, 2) + pow(j, 2);
                    
                    if (d2 > r2)
                        continue;
                    
                    // accumulate the quallity.
                    quality[{t[0] + i, t[1] + j}] += t[2] / (1.0 + sqrt(d2));
                }
        }
        
        int iii = 0;
        int jjj = 0;
        int qqq = 0;
        
        for (auto &p : quality)
        {
            if (qqq < p.second)
            {
                qqq = p.second;
                iii = p.first.first;
                jjj = p.first.second;
            }
            // since the map is internally sorted, we don't have to worry about the 'lexicographically minimum'
        }
        
        return {iii, jjj};
    }
