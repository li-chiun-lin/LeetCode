# Easy

You are given an integer array $nums$. You need to ensure that the elements in the array are distinct. To achieve this, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Remove 3 elements from the beginning of the array. If the array has fewer than 3 elements, remove all remaining elements.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the elements in the array distinct.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> seen; // To track unique elements encountered

        for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (seen.count(nums[i])) {
                return (i + 3) / 3; // Equivalent to (i + 1 + 2) / 3
            }
            seen.insert(nums[i]);
        }

        return 0; // No operations needed if no duplicates are found
    }
};
```
