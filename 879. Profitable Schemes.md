# Hard

There is a group of $n$ members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The $i$-th crime generates a $profit[i]$ and requires $group[i]$ members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least $minProfit$ profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most $n$.

Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int profitableSchemes(int n, int minProfit, vector<int>& group, vector<int>& profit) {
        int ret = 0;
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(minProfit + 1, vector<int>(n + 1));
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int k = 0; k < group.size(); ++k)
        {
            int g = group[k];
            int p = profit[k];

            for (int i = minProfit; i >= 0; --i)
                for (int j = n - g; j >= 0; --j)
                    dp[min(i + p, minProfit)][j + g] = (dp[min(i + p, minProfit)][j + g] + dp[i][j]) % mod;
        }

        for (int r : dp[minProfit])
            ret = (ret + r) % mod;

        return ret;
    }
};
```
