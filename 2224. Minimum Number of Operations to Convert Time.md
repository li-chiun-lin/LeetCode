# Easy

You are given two strings **current** and **correct** representing two 24-hour times.

24-hour times are formatted as **"HH:MM"**, where **HH** is between **00** and **23**, and **MM** is between **00** and **59**. The earliest 24-hour time is **00:00**, and the latest is **23:59**.

In one operation you can increase the time **current** by **1, 5, 15**, or **60** minutes. You can perform this operation **any** number of times.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to convert **current** to **correct**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int convertTime(string current, string correct) {
        int m = (correct[0] - current[0]) * 600 
              + (correct[1] - current[1]) * 60 
              + (correct[3] - current[3]) * 10 
              + (correct[4] - current[4]);
        
        int c = 0;
        
        c += m / 60;
        m %= 60;
        
        c += m / 15;
        m %= 15;
        
        c += m / 5;
        m %= 5;
        
        return c + m;
    }
};
```
