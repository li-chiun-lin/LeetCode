# Easy

You are given positive integers $n$ and $m$.

Define two integers, $num1$ and $num2$, as follows:

- $num1$: The sum of all integers in the range $[1, n]$ that are not divisible by $m$.
- $num2$: The sum of all integers in the range $[1, n]$ that are divisible by $m$.

Return the integer $num1 - num2$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Computes the difference between the sum of numbers from 1 to n 
    // that are not divisible by m and the sum of those that are divisible by m.
    int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int totalSum = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            // If i is not divisible by m, add it; otherwise, subtract it
            if (i % m != 0) {
                totalSum += i;
            } else {
                totalSum -= i;
            }
        }

        return totalSum;
    }
};
```
