# Easy

You are given positive integers $n$ and $m$.

Define two integers, $num1$ and $num2$, as follows:

- $num1$: The sum of all integers in the range $[1, n]$ that are not divisible by $m$.
- $num2$: The sum of all integers in the range $[1, n]$ that are divisible by $m$.

Return the integer $num1 - num2$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            sum += i % m ? i : -i;

        return sum; 
    }
};
```
