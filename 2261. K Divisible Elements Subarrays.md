Given an integer array **nums** and two integers **k** and **p**, return the number of distinct subarrays which have at most **k** elements divisible by **p**.

Two arrays **nums1** and **nums2** are said to be distinct if:

- They are of different lengths, or
- There exists at least one index i where **nums1[i] != nums2[i]**.

A subarray is defined as a non-empty contiguous sequence of elements in an array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDistinct(vector<int>& nums, int k, int p) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> acc(n + 1);
        
        // calculate the prefix sum of how many element can be divided by p.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            acc[i + 1] = acc[i] + (nums[i] % p == 0);
        
        // I don't usually use the set of vectors, but in this case, it will do fine.
        map<int, set<vector<int>>> ss;
        
        // for every combination of substring between i and j, 
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j)
                // if there are at most k elements can be divided by p, 
                if (acc[i] - acc[j] <= k)
                    // put it into the set for deduplication.
                    ss[i - j].insert(vector<int>(nums.begin() + j, nums.begin() + i));
        
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (auto &h : ss)
            ret += h.second.size();
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
