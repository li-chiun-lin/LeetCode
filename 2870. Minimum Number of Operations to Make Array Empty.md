# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed array $nums$ consisting of positive integers.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

- Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
- Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or $-1$ if it is not possible.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> hist;
        int max_cnt = 0;
        
        for (auto x : nums)
        {
            ++ hist[x];
            max_cnt = max(max_cnt, hist[x]);
        }
        
        vector<int> dp(max(max_cnt, 4) + 1);
        
        dp[1] = 1e9;
        dp[2] = 1;
        dp[3] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 4; i <= max_cnt; ++i)
            dp[i] = min(dp[i - 2], dp[i - 3]) + 1;
        
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (auto [k, v] : hist)
        {
            if (v == 1)
                return -1;
            
            cnt += dp[v];
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
