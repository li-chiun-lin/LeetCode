Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a string array $board$, return $true$ if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The board is a $3 \times 3$ array that consists of characters ' ', 'X', and 'O'. The ' ' character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
- The first player always places 'X' characters, while the second player always places 'O' characters.
- 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
- The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.

    bool win(vector<string>& board, char c)

        {
            int cnt = 0;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j)
