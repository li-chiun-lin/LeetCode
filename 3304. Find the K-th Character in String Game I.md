# Easy

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string $word$ = "a".

You are given a positive integer $k$.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:

- Generate a new string by changing each character in $word$ to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original $word$.

Return the value of the $k$-th character in $word$, after enough operations have been done for $word$ to have at least $k$ characters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the k-th character in the generated sequence
    char kthCharacter(int k) {
        string sequence = "a";  // Start the sequence with 'a'

        // Extend the sequence until it has at least k characters
        while (sequence.size() < k) {
            int currentLength = sequence.size();

            // For each existing character, append its successor in the alphabet
            for (int i = 0; i < currentLength; ++i) {
                char nextChar = (sequence[i] - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a';  // Wrap around after 'z'
                sequence.push_back(nextChar);
            }
        }

        // Return the k-th character (1-indexed)
        return sequence[k - 1];
    }
};
```
