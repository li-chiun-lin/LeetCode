# Easy

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string $word$ = "a".

You are given a positive integer $k$.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:

- Generate a new string by changing each character in $word$ to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original $word$.

Return the value of the $k$-th character in $word$, after enough operations have been done for $word$ to have at least $k$ characters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char kthCharacter(int k) {
        string w = "a";
        int s = 0;

        while ((s = size(w)) < k)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < s; ++i)
                w.push_back((w[i] - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a');
        }

        return w[k - 1];
    }
};
```
