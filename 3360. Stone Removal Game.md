# Easy

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing stones from a pile, with Alice going first.

- Alice starts by removing exactly 10 stones on her first turn.
- For each subsequent turn, each player removes exactly 1 fewer stone than the previous opponent.

The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

Given a positive integer $n$, return $true$ if Alice wins the game and $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canAliceWin(int n) {
        bool isAliceWin = false; // Tracks whether Alice will win: false = opponent's win, true = Alice's win
        int remove_stone = 10;   // Initial number of stones to remove

        // Simulate the game
        while (n >= remove_stone) {
            isAliceWin = !isAliceWin; // Toggle the winner
            n -= remove_stone--;     // Reduce `n` and decrement the removal value
        }

        return isAliceWin; // Return true if Alice wins
    }
};

```
