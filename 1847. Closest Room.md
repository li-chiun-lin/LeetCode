# Hard

There is a hotel with $n$ rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array $rooms$ where $rooms[i] = [roomId_i, size_i]$ denotes that there is a room with room number $roomId_i$ and size equal to $size_i$. Each $roomId_i$ is guaranteed to be unique.

You are also given $k$ queries in a 2D array $queries$ where $queries[j] = [preferred_j, minSize_j]$. The answer to the $j$-th query is the room number id of a room such that:

- The room has a size of at least $minSize_j$, and
- $abs(id - preferred_j)$ is minimized.

If there is a tie in the absolute difference, then use the room with the smallest such id. If there is no such room, the answer is $-1$.

Return an array $answer$ of length $k$ where $answer[j]$ contains the answer to the $j$-th query.
