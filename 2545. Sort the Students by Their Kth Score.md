# Medium

There is a class with $m$ students and $n$ exams. You are given a 0-indexed $m \times n$ integer matrix $score$, where each row represents one student and $score[i] [j]$ denotes the score the $i$-th student got in the $j$-th exam. The matrix $score$ contains distinct integers only.

You are also given an integer $k$. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the $k$-th (0-indexed) exam from the highest to the lowest.

Return the matrix after sorting it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> sortTheStudents(vector<vector<int>>& score, int k) {
        auto cmp = [&] (vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b)
        {
            return a[k] > b[k];
        };

        sort(begin(score), end(score), cmp);

        return score;
    }
};
```
