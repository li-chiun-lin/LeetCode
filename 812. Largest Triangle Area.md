Given an array of points on the X-Y plane $points$ where $points[i] = [x_i, y_i]$, return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within $10^{-5}$ of the actual answer will be accepted.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double largestTriangleArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int m = 0.0;
        int s = points.size();
        int a = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s; ++i)
            for (int j = i + 1; j < s; ++j)
                for (int k = j + 1; k < s; ++k)
                {
                    a = abs(
                        points[i][1] * (points[j][0] - points[k][0]) + 
                        points[j][1] * (points[k][0] - points[i][0]) +
                        points[k][1] * (points[i][0] - points[j][0]));
                    
                    m = max(m, a);
                }
        
        return (double)m / 2;
    }
};
```
