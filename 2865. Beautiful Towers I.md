You are given a 0-indexed array $maxHeights$ of $n$ integers.

You are tasked with building $n$ towers in the coordinate line. The $i$-th tower is built at coordinate $i$ and has a height of $heights[i]$.

A configuration of towers is beautiful if the following conditions hold:

- $1 <= heights[i] \leq maxHeights[i]$
- $heights$ is a mountain array.

Array $heights$ is a mountain if there exists an index $i$ such that:

- For all $0 < j \leq i, heights[j - 1] \leq heights[j]$
- For all $i \leq k < n - 1, heights[k + 1] \leq heights[k]$

Return the maximum possible sum of heights of a beautiful configuration of towers.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumSumOfHeights(vector<int>& maxHeights) {
        int n = size(maxHeights);
        long long sum = 0;
        
        for (int p = 0; p < n; ++p)
        {
            long long loc = maxHeights[p];
            
            for (int i = p - 1, ub = maxHeights[p]; i >= 0; --i)
                loc += ub = min(ub, maxHeights[i]);
            
            for (int i = p + 1, ub = maxHeights[p]; i < n; ++i)
                loc += ub = min(ub, maxHeights[i]);
            
            sum = max(sum, loc);
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
