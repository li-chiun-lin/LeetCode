You are given an integer $n$ and an undirected graph with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$. This is represented by a 2D array $edges$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, time_i]$ indicates an undirected edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$ that can be removed at $time_i$.

You are also given an integer $k$.

Initially, the graph may be connected or disconnected. Your task is to find the minimum time $t$ such that after removing all edges with $time \leq t$, the graph contains at least $k$ connected components.

Return the minimum time $t$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTime(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int k) {
        // Step 1: Sort edges in descending order by weight (edge[2])
        sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[2] > b[2];
        });

        // Step 2: Initialize Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure
        vector<int> parent(n);
        iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);  // Initially, each node is its own parent

        // Union-Find: Find with path compression
        function<int(int)> find = [&](int x) -> int {
            if (parent[x] != x)
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            return parent[x];
        };

        // Union-Find: Union two sets, return true if merged
        auto unite = [&](int x, int y) -> bool {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        };

        // Step 3: Use Kruskal-like approach from strongest edges
        // Merge components until we have exactly `k` connected components
        int components = n;

        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], time = edge[2];

            if (unite(u, v)) {
                --components;
                if (components < k)
                    return time;  // As soon as we reduce components to k, this is the answer
            }
        }

        // If we never reduce to `k` components, return 0 (although per constraints, this shouldn't happen)
        return 0;
    }
};
```
