An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of $2^n$ integers where:

- Every integer is in the inclusive range $[0, 2^n - 1]$,
- The first integer is $0$,
- An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
- The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.

Given an integer $n$, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        if (n == 1)
            return {0, 1};
        
        vector<int> n1 = grayCode(n - 1);
        int size = n1.size();
        
        n1.resize(size + size);
        unsigned int one = 1 << (n - 1);
        
        for (int i = 0, j = n1.size() - 1; i < j; ++ i, --j)
            n1[j] = n1[i] | one;
        
        return n1;
    }
};
```
