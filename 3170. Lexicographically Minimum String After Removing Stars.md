# Medium

You are given a string $s$. It may contain any number of '\*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.

While there is a '\*', do the following operation:

- Delete the leftmost '\*' and the smallest non-'\*' character to its left. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.

Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '\*' characters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string clearStars(string s) {
        // Store positions of each character a-z
        vector<vector<int>> idx(26);

        // First pass to process '*' and mark removed characters as ' '
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '*') {
                // Find the smallest lexicographical character available
                for (int c = 0; c < 26; ++c) {
                    if (!idx[c].empty()) {
                        s[idx[c].back()] = ' '; // Mark for removal
                        idx[c].pop_back();
                        break;
                    }
                }
            } else {
                idx[s[i] - 'a'].push_back(i); // Record index
            }
        }

        // Build the final string without '*' or marked characters
        string result;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c != '*' && c != ' ')
                result.push_back(c);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
