# Medium

You are given a string $s$. It may contain any number of '\*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.

While there is a '\*', do the following operation:

- Delete the leftmost '\*' and the smallest non-'\*' character to its left. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.

Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '\*' characters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string clearStars(string s) {
        vector<vector<int>> idx(26);

        for (int i = 0; i < size(s); ++i)
        {
            if (s[i] == '*')
            {
                for (auto& ii : idx)
                    if (size(ii))
                    {
                        s[ii.back()] = ' ';
                        ii.pop_back();
                        break;
                    }
            }
            else
            {
                idx[s[i] - 'a'].push_back(i);
            }
        }

        string t = "";

        for (char c : s)
            if (c != '*' && c != ' ')
                t.push_back(c);

        return t;
    }
};
```
