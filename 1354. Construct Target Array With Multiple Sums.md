# Hard

You are given an array $target$ of $n$ integers. From a starting array $arr$ consisting of $n$ $1$'s, you may perform the following procedure :

- let $x$ be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
- choose index $i$, such that $0 <= i < n$ and set the value of $arr$ at index $i$ to $x$.
- You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.

Return $true$ if it is possible to construct the $target$ array from $arr$, otherwise, return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& target) {
        long long sum = accumulate(begin(target), end(target), 0L);
        priority_queue<int> pq(begin(target), end(target));
        
        while (pq.top() != 1)
        {
            int t = pq.top();
            
            sum -= t;
            
            if (t <= sum || sum < 1)
                return false;
            
            t %= sum;
            sum += t;
            
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(t ? t : sum);
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
