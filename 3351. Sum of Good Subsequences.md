# Hard

You are given an integer array $nums$. A good subsequence is defined as a subsequence of $nums$ where the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the subsequence is exactly 1.

Return the sum of all possible good subsequences of $nums$.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfGoodSubsequences(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        
        // Maps to store the count and sum of good subsequences ending at each unique number
        map<int, long long> dp_count, dp_sum;
        
        long long totalSum = 0;

        // Process each number in nums
        for (int x : nums) {
            // Update the count of good subsequences ending at x
            dp_count[x] = (dp_count[x] + dp_count[x - 1] + dp_count[x + 1] + 1) % MOD;

            // Calculate the new sum for subsequences ending at x by extending those ending at x-1 and x+1
            long long currentSum = (dp_sum[x - 1] + dp_sum[x + 1] 
                                    + (dp_count[x - 1] + dp_count[x + 1] + 1) * x) % MOD;
            
            // Update the sum of subsequences ending at x
            dp_sum[x] = (dp_sum[x] + currentSum) % MOD;

            // Add to the total sum of all good subsequences
            totalSum = (totalSum + currentSum) % MOD;
        }
        
        return totalSum;
    }
};
