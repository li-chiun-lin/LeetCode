Given a $n \times n$ matrix $grid$ of $0$'s and $1$'s only. We want to represent the $grid$ with a Quad-Tree.

Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the $grid$.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to $true$ or $false$ when $isLeaf$ is $false$, and both are accepted in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

- $val$: $true$ if the node represents a grid of $1$'s or $false$ if the node represents a grid of $0$'s.
- $isLeaf$: $true$ if the node is leaf node on the tree or $false$ if the node has the four children.

```cpp
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

- If the current grid has the same value (i.e all $1$'s or all $0$'s) set $isLeaf$ $true$ and set $val$ to the value of the grid and set the four children to $null$ and stop.
- If the current grid has different values, set $isLeaf$ to $false$ and set $val$ to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids.
- Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.

## Quad-Tree format

The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where $null$ signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list $[isLeaf, val]$.

If the value of $isLeaf$ or $val$ is $true$ we represent it as $1$ in the list $[isLeaf, val]$ and if the value of $isLeaf$ or $val$ is $false$ we represent it as $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* rec(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y, int n)
    {
        if (n == 1)
            return new Node(grid[x][y], true);
        
        int n2 = n / 2;
        
        Node *tl = rec(grid, x     , y     , n2);
        Node *tr = rec(grid, x     , y + n2, n2);
        Node *bl = rec(grid, x + n2, y     , n2);
        Node *br = rec(grid, x + n2, y + n2, n2);
        
        if (tl->isLeaf && 
            tr->isLeaf && 
            bl->isLeaf && 
            br->isLeaf && 
            tl->val == tr->val && 
            tl->val == bl->val && 
            tl->val == br->val)
            return new Node(tl->val, true);
        
        return new Node(false, false, tl, tr, bl, br);
    }
    
    Node* construct(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        
        return rec(grid, 0, 0, n);
    }
};
```
