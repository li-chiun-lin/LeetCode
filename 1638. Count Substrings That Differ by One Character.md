Given two strings $s$ and $t$, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of $s$ and replace a single character by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of $t$. In other words, find the number of substrings in $s$ that differ from some substring in $t$ by exactly one character.

Return the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(string s, string t) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = size(s);
        int m = size(t);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)
            {
                int dif = 0;

                for (int k = 0; i + k < n && j + k < m; ++k)
                {
                    if (s[i + k] != t[j + k] && ++ dif > 1)
                        break;

                    ans += dif;
                }
            }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
