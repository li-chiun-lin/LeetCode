A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of $n$ nodes labelled from $0$ to $n - 1$, and an array of $n - 1$ edges where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node $x$ as the root, the result tree has height $h$. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs).

Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.

The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        if (n == 1) 
            return vector<int>{0};

        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        vector<int> degree(n);
        vector<int> ret;
        queue<int> que;
        int s = 0;

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
            ++degree[e[0]];
            ++degree[e[1]];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            if (degree[i] == 1) 
                que.push(i);

        while (s = que.size())
        {
            ret.clear();

            while (s--)
            {
                int u = que.front();
                que.pop();

                ret.push_back(u);

                for (int v : adj[u])
                    if (--degree[v] == 1)
                        que.push(v);
            }
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
```
