You are given two arrays $rowSum$ and $colSum$ of non-negative integers where $rowSum[i]$ is the sum of the elements in the $i$-th row and $colSum[j]$ is the sum of the elements of the $j$-th column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.

Find any matrix of non-negative integers of size $rowSum.length * colSum.length$ that satisfies the $rowSum$ and $colSum $requirements.

Return a 2D array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements. It's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> restoreMatrix(vector<int>& rowSum, vector<int>& colSum) {
        int m = rowSum.size();
        int n = colSum.size();
        vector<vector<int>> ret(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n && rowSum[i]; ++j)
            {
                int d = min(colSum[j], rowSum[i]);
                rowSum[i] -= d;
                colSum[j] -= d;
                ret[i][j] += d;
            }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
