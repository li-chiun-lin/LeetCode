You are given a positive integer **p**. Consider an array **nums** (1-indexed) that consists of the integers in the inclusive range **[1, 2<sup>p</sup> - 1]** in their binary representations. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times:

- Choose two elements **x** and **y** from nums.
- Choose a bit in **x** and swap it with its corresponding bit in **y**. Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the **same position** in the other integer.

For example, if **x** = 11**0**1 and **y** = 00**1**1, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have **x** = 11**1**1 and **y** = 00**0**1.

Find the **minimum non-zero** product of **nums** after performing the above operation any number of times. Return this product **modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7**.

Note: The answer should be the minimum product **before** the modulo operation is done.

# My Solution

Assuming **p = 4**.

|-:|-:|
| 7 = 0111 |  8 = 1000 |
| 6 = 0110 |  9 = 1001 |
| 5 = 0101 | 10 = 1010 |
| 4 = 0100 | 11 = 1011 |
| 3 = 0011 | 12 = 1100 |
| 2 = 0010 | 13 = 1101 |
| 1 = 0001 | 14 = 1110 |
|          | 15 = 1111 |

We can do

1. move all the LSB to the left group.
1. move other bits to the right group.

| 1 = 0001 | 14 = 1110 |
| 1 = 0001 | 14 = 1110 |

    int minNonZeroProduct(int p) {
        long long val = ((long long)1 << p) - 1;
        long long val1 = val - 1;
        long long half = val >> 1;
