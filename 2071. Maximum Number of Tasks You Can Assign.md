# Hard

You have $n$ tasks and $m$ workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array $tasks$, with the $i$-th task requiring $tasks[i]$ strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array $workers$, with the $j$-th worker having $workers[j]$ strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement.

Additionally, you have $pills$ magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by $strength$. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.

Given the 0-indexed integer arrays $tasks$ and $workers$ and the integers $pills$ and $strength$, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.

        int right = min(tasks.size(), workers.size()); // Max tasks cannot exceed number of workers or tasks

        // Sort tasks and workers in ascending order

            int usedPills = 0;

            // Use the strongest `mid` workers
            multiset<int> availableWorkers(workers.end() - mid, workers.end());
