# Hard

You have $n$ tasks and $m$ workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array $tasks$, with the $i$-th task requiring $tasks[i]$ strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array $workers$, with the $j$-th worker having $workers[j]$ strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement.

Additionally, you have $pills$ magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by $strength$. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.

Given the 0-indexed integer arrays $tasks$ and $workers$ and the integers $pills$ and $strength$, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxTaskAssign(vector<int>& tasks, vector<int>& workers, int pills, int strength) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = min(size(tasks), size(workers));
        
        sort(begin(tasks), end(tasks));
        sort(begin(workers), end(workers));

        while (l < r)
        {
            int m = (l + r + 1) / 2;
            int p = 0;
            multiset<int> ms(end(workers) - m, end(workers));

            for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; --i)
            {
                auto it = prev(end(ms));

                if (*it < tasks[i])
                {
                    it = ms.lower_bound(tasks[i] - strength);

                    if (it == end(ms) || ++ p > pills)
                        break;
                }

                ms.erase(it);
            }

            if (size(ms))
                r = m - 1;
            else
                l = m;
        }

        return l;
    }
};
