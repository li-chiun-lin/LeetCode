# Easy

You are given an $m \times n$ binary matrix $mat$ of $1$'s (representing soldiers) and $0$'s (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the $1$'s will appear to the left of all the $0$'s in each row.

A row $i$ is weaker than a row $j$ if one of the following is true:

- The number of soldiers in row $i$ is less than the number of soldiers in row $j$.
- Both rows have the same number of soldiers and $i < j$.

Return the indices of the $k$ weakest rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> kWeakestRows(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        vector<int> ret(k);
        vector<pair<int, int>> val(m);
        
        for (int r = 0; r < m; ++r)
        {
            int c = 0;
            
            while (c < n && mat[r][c] == 1)
                ++ c;
            
            val[r] = {c, r};
        }
        
        sort(begin(val), end(val));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
            ret[i] = val[i].second;
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
