You are given an array of strings $products$ and a string $searchWord$.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from $products$ after each character of $searchWord$ is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with $searchWord$. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of $searchWord$ is typed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> suggestedProducts(vector<string>& products, string searchWord) {
        int n = searchWord.size();
        vector<vector<string>> ret(n);
        vector<set<string>> ss(2);
        int from = 0;
        int to = 1;
        
        ss[from] = set<string>(products.begin(), products.end());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            to = 1 - from;
            ss[to].clear();
            
            for (const string &s : ss[from])
                if (s[i] == searchWord[i])
                    ss[to].insert(s);
            
            for (const string &s : ss[to])
            {
                ret[i].push_back(s);
                if (ret[i].size() == 3)
                    break;
            }
            
            from = to;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
