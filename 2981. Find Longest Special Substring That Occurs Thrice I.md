You are given a string $s$ that consists of lowercase English letters.

A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.

Return the length of the longest special substring of $s$ which occurs at least thrice, or $-1$ if no special substring occurs at least thrice.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumLength(string s) {
        int n = size(s);
        vector<vector<int>> hist(26, vector<int>(n + 2));
        
        char pre = s[0];
        int cnt = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            char c = s[i];
            
            if (pre != c)
            {
                ++ hist[pre - 'a'][cnt];
                pre = c;
                cnt = 1;
            }
            else
                ++ cnt;
        }
        
        ++ hist[pre - 'a'][cnt];
        
        for (int len = n; len > 0; --len)
            for (int ch = 0; ch < 26; ++ch)
                if ((hist[ch][len] += hist[ch][len + 1] * 2) >= 3)
                    return len;
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```
