You are given a string $s$ that consists of lowercase English letters.

A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.

Return the length of the longest special substring of $s$ which occurs at least thrice, or $-1$ if no special substring occurs at least thrice.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumLength(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        
        // Create histogram for character segments
        vector<vector<int>> hist(26, vector<int>(n + 2, 0));

        // Count consecutive character segments
        char current_char = s[0];
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] != current_char) {
                hist[current_char - 'a'][count]++;
                current_char = s[i];
                count = 1;
            } else {
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Add the last counted segment
        hist[current_char - 'a'][count]++;

        // Traverse lengths from maximum to minimum
        for (int len = n; len > 0; --len) {
            for (int ch = 0; ch < 26; ++ch) {
                // Accumulate counts for lengths longer than `len`
                hist[ch][len] += hist[ch][len + 1] * 2;

                // Check if any character has 3 or more occurrences of length `len`
                if (hist[ch][len] >= 3) {
                    return len;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1; // No valid length found
    }
};
