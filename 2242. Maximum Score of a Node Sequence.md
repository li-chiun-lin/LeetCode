# Hard

There is an undirected graph with $n$ nodes, numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $scores$ of length $n$ where $scores[i]$ denotes the score of node $i$. You are also given a 2D integer array $edges$ where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$.

A node sequence is valid if it meets the following conditions:

- There is an edge connecting every pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence.
- No node appears more than once in the sequence.

The score of a node sequence is defined as the sum of the scores of the nodes in the sequence.

Return the maximum score of a valid node sequence with a length of $4$. If no such sequence exists, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumScore(vector<int>& scores, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = size(scores);
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        for (auto& a : adj)
            sort(begin(a), end(a), [&](auto a, auto b)
            {
                return scores[a] > scores[b];
            });

        int ans = -1;

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            int u = e[0];
            int v = e[1];
            int s = scores[u] + scores[v];

            for (int i = 0; i < 3 && i < size(adj[u]); ++i)
            {
                int x = adj[u][i];

                if (x == v)
                    continue;

                for (int j = 0; j < 3 && j < size(adj[v]); ++j)
                {
                    int y = adj[v][j];

                    if (y == u || y == x)
                        continue;

                    ans = max(ans, s + scores[x] + scores[y]);
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
