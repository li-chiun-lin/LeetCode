# Easy

Given an integer $num$, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by $2$, otherwise, you have to subtract $1$ from it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        int cnt = 0;
        
        while (num > 1)
        {
            cnt += num & 1;
            num >>= 1;
            ++ cnt;
        }
        
        return cnt + num;
    }
};
```
