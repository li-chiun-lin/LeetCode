# Easy

You are given a positive integer $n$, that is initially placed on a board. Every day, for $10^9$ days, you perform the following procedure:

- For each number $x$ present on the board, find all numbers $1 \leq i \leq n$ such that $x \mod i == 1$.
- Then, place those numbers on the board.

Return the number of distinct integers present on the board after $10^9$ days have elapsed.

Note:

- Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distinctIntegers(int n) {
        return n == 1 ? 1 : n - 1;
    }
};
```
