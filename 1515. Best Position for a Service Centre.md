A delivery company wants to build a new service center in a new city. The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new center in a position such that the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum.

Given an array $positions$ where $positions[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ is the position of the $i$-th customer on the map, return the minimum sum of the euclidean distances to all customers.

In other words, you need to choose the position of the service center $[x_{centre}, y_{centre}]$ such that the following formula is minimized:

$\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}\sqrt{(x_{centre} - x_i)^2+(y_{centre} - y_i)^2}$

        for (auto& p : positions)
        {
            l = min(l, (double)p[0]);
            r = max(r, (double)p[0]);
            t = max(t, (double)p[1]);
            b = min(b, (double)p[1]);
        }

        double ans = DBL_MAX, c_x = 0, c_y = 0;

                        d += sqrt(pow(p[0] - x, 2) + pow(p[1] - y, 2));
