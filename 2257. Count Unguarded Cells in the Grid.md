# Medium

You are given two integers **m** and **n** representing a 0-indexed **m x n** grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays **guards** and **walls** where **guards[i] = [row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>]** and **walls[j] = [row<sub>j</sub>, col<sub>j</sub>]** represent the positions of the **i**-th guard and **j**-th wall respectively.

A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.

Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

## My Solution

The one thing that I think worth noting is: the eyesight of a guard can across those of others.

I set the cell to 2 where there is (physcially) a wall or a guard.
I set the cell to 1 where there are some eyesight come across it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countUnguarded(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& guards, vector<vector<int>>& walls) {
        vector<vector<int>> grid(m, vector<int>(n));
        
        for (auto &g : guards)
            grid[g[0]][g[1]] = 2;
        
        for (auto &w : walls)
            grid[w[0]][w[1]] = 2;
        
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        
        for (auto &g : guards)
        {
            i = g[0] - 1;
            j = g[1];
            
            // go up
            while (i >= 0 && grid[i][j] != 2)
                grid[i --][j] = 1;
            
            i = g[0] + 1;
            
            // go down
            while (i < m && grid[i][j] != 2)
                grid[i ++][j] = 1;
            
            i = g[0];
            j = g[1] - 1;
            
            // go left
            while (j >= 0 && grid[i][j] != 2)
                grid[i][j --] = 1;
            
            j = g[1] + 1;
            
            // go right
            while (j < n && grid[i][j] != 2)
                grid[i][j ++] = 1;
        }
        
        int c = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                c += grid[i][j] == 0;
        
        return c;
    }
};
```
