You are given an integer $n$, a 0-indexed string array $words$, and a 0-indexed binary array $groups$, both arrays having length $n$.

You need to select the longest subsequence from an array of indices $[0, 1, ..., n - 1]$, such that for the subsequence denoted as $[i_0, i_1, ..., i_{k - 1}]$ having length $k$, $groups[i_j] \neq groups[i_{j + 1}]$, for each $j$ where $0 < j + 1 < k$.

Return a string array containing the words corresponding to the indices (in order) in the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

A subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (possibly none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Returns the words that form the longest subsequence where 
    // consecutive words come from different groups
    vector<string> getLongestSubsequence(vector<string>& words, vector<int>& groups) {
        int n = size(words);
        vector<string> result;  // Stores the final subsequence
        int previousGroup = -1; // Tracks the group of the last added word
        
        // Iterate over each word and its corresponding group
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Add the word to the result if its group differs from the previous one
            if (groups[i] != previousGroup) {
                result.push_back(words[i]);
                previousGroup = groups[i]; // Update the last used group
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
