You are given an integer $n$, a 0-indexed string array $words$, and a 0-indexed binary array $groups$, both arrays having length $n$.

You need to select the longest subsequence from an array of indices $[0, 1, ..., n - 1]$, such that for the subsequence denoted as $[i_0, i_1, ..., i_{k - 1}]$ having length $k$, $groups[i_j] \neq groups[i_{j + 1}]$, for each $j$ where $0 < j + 1 < k$.

Return a string array containing the words corresponding to the indices (in order) in the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

A subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (possibly none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> getWordsInLongestSubsequence(int n, vector<string>& words, vector<int>& groups) {
        vector<string> ans;
        int prev = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (groups[i] != prev)
            {
                prev = groups[i];
                ans.push_back(words[i]);
            }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
