# Easy

You are given a string **s** consisting of **n** characters which are either **'X'** or **'O'**.

A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of **s** and converting them to **'O'**. Note that if a move is applied to the character **'O'**, it will stay the same.

Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of **s** are converted to **'O'**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMoves(string s) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int pre = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
        {
            if (s[i] != 'O')
            {
                if (++ pre == 2)
                {
                    ++ cnt;
                    ++ i;
                    pre = 0;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                if (pre)
                {
                    ++ cnt;
                    ++ i;
                    pre = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (pre)
            ++ cnt;
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
