# Easy

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from $1$ to $n$. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API **int guess(int num)**, which returns three possible results:

- $-1$: Your guess is higher than the number I picked.
- $1$: Your guess is lower than the number I picked.
- $0$: your guess is equal to the number I picked.

Return the number that I picked.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left <= right)
        {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int ret = guess(mid);

            if (ret == 0)
                return mid;
            else if (ret > 0)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }

        return 0;
    }
};
```
