You are given a 2D integer array $ranges$ where $ranges[i] = [start_i, end_i]$ denotes that all integers between $start_i$ and $end_i$ (both inclusive) are contained in the $i$-th range.

You are to split ranges into two (possibly empty) groups such that:

- Each range belongs to exactly one group.
- Any two overlapping ranges must belong to the same group.

Two ranges are said to be overlapping if there exists at least one integer that is present in both ranges.

Return the total number of ways to split ranges into two groups. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countWays(vector<vector<int>>& ranges) {
        sort(begin(ranges), end(ranges));
        
        int cnt = 0;
        int end = INT_MIN;
        
        for (auto& r : ranges)
        {
            if (end < r[0])
            {
                ++ cnt;
                end = r[1];
            }
            else
                end = max(end, r[1]);
        }
        
        long long v = 1;
        long long m = 1e9 + 7;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < cnt; ++i)
            v = (v << 1) % m;
        
        return v;
    }
};
```
