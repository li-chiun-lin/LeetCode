# Medium

There is a regular convex polygon with $n$ vertices. The vertices are labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$ in a clockwise direction, and each vertex has exactly one monkey.

Each monkey moves simultaneously to a neighboring vertex. A neighboring vertex for a vertex $i$ can be:

- the vertex $(i + 1) \mod n$ in the clockwise direction, or
- the vertex $(i - 1 + n) \mod n$ in the counter-clockwise direction.

A collision happens if at least two monkeys reside on the same vertex after the movement.

Return the number of ways the monkeys can move so that at least one collision happens. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

Note that each monkey can only move once.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int pow(long long a, int b, int n)
    {
        long long r = 1;
        
        while (b)
        {
            if (b & 1)
                r = (r * a) % n;
            
            a = (a * a) % n;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        
        return r;
    }
    
public:
    int monkeyMove(int n) {
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        return ((pow(2, n, m) - 2) + m) % m;
    }
};
```
