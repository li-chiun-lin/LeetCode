# Medium

Alice frequently takes exams and wants to track her scores and calculate the total scores over specific time periods.

Implement the __ExamTracker__ class:

- __ExamTracker()__: Initializes the ExamTracker object.
- __void record(int time, int score)__: Alice takes a new exam at time $time$ and achieves the score $score$.
- __long long totalScore(int startTime, int endTime)__: Returns an integer that represents the total score of all exams taken by Alice between $startTime$ and $endTime$ (inclusive). If there are no recorded exams taken by Alice within the specified time interval, return 0.

It is guaranteed that the function calls are made in chronological order. That is,

- Calls to __record()__ will be made with strictly increasing $time$.
- Alice will never ask for total scores that require information from the future. That is, if the latest __record()__ is called with $time = t$, then __totalScore()__ will always be called with $startTime \leq endTime \leq t$.

```cpp
class ExamTracker {
    vector<pair<int, long long>> vec;
public:
    ExamTracker() {
        vec.push_back({0, 0});
    }
    
    void record(int time, int score) {
        vec.push_back({time, vec.back().second + score});
    }
    
    long long totalScore(int startTime, int endTime) {
        pair<int, long long> l = {startTime, 0};
        pair<int, long long> r = {endTime, LLONG_MAX};
        auto left = lower_bound(begin(vec), end(vec), l);
        auto right = lower_bound(begin(vec), end(vec), r);

        return prev(right)->second - prev(left)->second;
    }
};
```
