You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase English letters.

You must repeatedly perform the following operation while the string $s$ has at least two consecutive characters:

- Remove the leftmost pair of adjacent characters in the string that are consecutive in the alphabet, in either order.
- Shift the remaining characters to the left to fill the gap.

Return the resulting string after no more operations can be performed.

Note: Consider the alphabet as circular, thus 'a' and 'z' are consecutive.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Removes adjacent characters from the string if they are consecutive in the alphabet
    // (e.g., 'a' and 'b', or 'z' and 'a') based on the rule: abs difference = 1 or 25 (wraparound).
    string resultingString(string s) {
        string result;

        for (char c : s) {
            if (!result.empty()) {
                // Calculate alphabet index difference between last char in result and current char
                int lastCharIndex = result.back() - 'a';
                int currentCharIndex = c - 'a';
                int diff = abs(lastCharIndex - currentCharIndex);

                // If the characters are consecutive (wrap-around or adjacent), remove the last one
                if (diff == 1 || diff == 25) {
                    result.pop_back();
                } else {
                    result.push_back(c);
                }
            } else {
                // If result is empty, just add the first character
                result.push_back(c);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
