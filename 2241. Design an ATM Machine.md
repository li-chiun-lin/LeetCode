There is an ATM machine that stores banknotes of **5** denominations: **20, 50, 100, 200**, and **500** dollars. Initially the ATM is empty. The user can use the machine to deposit or withdraw any amount of money.

When withdrawing, the machine prioritizes using banknotes of **larger** values.

- For example, if you want to withdraw **$300** and there are **2** **$50** banknotes, **1** **$100** banknote, and **1** **$200** banknote, then the machine will use the **$100** and **$200** banknotes.
- However, if you try to withdraw **$600** and there are **3** **$200** banknotes and **1** **$500** banknote, then the withdraw request will be rejected because the machine will first try to use the **$500** banknote and then be unable to use banknotes to complete the remaining **$100**. Note that the machine is not allowed to use the **$200** banknotes instead of the **$500** banknote.

Implement the ATM class:

- **ATM()** Initializes the ATM object.
- **void deposit(int[] banknotesCount)** Deposits new banknotes in the order **$20, $50, $100, $200**, and **$500**.
- **int[] withdraw(int amount)** Returns an array of length **5** of the number of banknotes that will be handed to the user in the order **$20, $50, $100, $200**, and **$500**, and update the number of banknotes in the ATM after withdrawing. Returns **[-1]** if it is not possible (do **not** withdraw any banknotes in this case).

## My Solution

The **withdraw** is the most error-prone part.
We start from the largest banknote, substract/divide it from the **amoount**.
After we go through every type of banknotes, if there are any **amount** left,
then it is impossible to withdraw.
Only one reminder: when it is impossible to withdraw, remember to put all the banknotes back to bank, a.k.a. rollback.

```cpp
class ATM {
    vector<int> val;
    vector<long long> cnt;
    
public:
    ATM() {
        val = {20, 50, 100, 200, 500};
        cnt = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    }
    
    void deposit(vector<int> banknotesCount) {
        for (int i = 0; i < banknotesCount.size(); ++i)
            cnt[i] += banknotesCount[i];
    }
    
    vector<int> withdraw(int amount) {
        vector<int> ret(5);
        
        for (int i = 4; i >= 0 && amount; --i)
        {
            // this is a small trick.
            long long q = min((long long)amount / val[i], cnt[i]);
            
            cnt[i] -= q;
            ret[i] = q;
            amount -= q * val[i];
        }
        
        if (amount)
        {
            // this is somehow the most error-prone part.
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
                cnt[i] += ret[i];

            return {-1};
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
