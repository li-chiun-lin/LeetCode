# Easy

You are given three positive integers $num1$, $num2$, and $num3$.

The key of $num1$, $num2$, and $num3$ is defined as a four-digit number such that:

- Initially, if any number has less than four digits, it is padded with leading zeros.
- The $i$-th digit $(1 <= i <= 4)$ of the $key$ is generated by taking the smallest digit among the $i$-th digits of $num1$, $num2$, and $num3$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int generateKey(int num1, int num2, int num3) {
        int ans = 0;
        int base = 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
        {
            ans += min(num1 % 10, min(num2 % 10, num3 % 10)) * base;
            
            num1 /= 10;
            num2 /= 10;
            num3 /= 10;
            base *= 10;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
