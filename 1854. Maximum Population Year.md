# Easy

You are given a 2D integer array **logs** where each **logs[i] = [birth<sub>i</sub>, death<sub>i</sub>]** indicates the birth and death years of the **i**-th person.

The population of some year **x** is the number of people alive during that year. The **i**-th person is counted in year **x**'s population if **x** is in the inclusive range **[birth<sub>i</sub>, death<sub>i - 1</sub>]**. Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die.

Return the earliest year with the maximum population.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumPopulation(vector<vector<int>>& logs) {
        map<int, int> hist;
        
        for (auto &v : logs)
        {
            ++ hist[v[0]];
            -- hist[v[1]];
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        int m = 0;
        int y = 0;
        
        for (auto &h : hist)
        {
            sum += h.second;
            
            if (m < sum)
            {
                m = sum;
                y = h.first;
            }
        }
        
        return y;
    }
};
```
