# Medium

You are given an integer array $nums$ with a length divisible by 3.

You want to make the array empty in steps. In each step, you can select any three elements from the array, compute their median, and remove the selected elements from the array.

The median of an odd-length sequence is defined as the middle element of the sequence when it is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return the maximum possible sum of the medians computed from the selected elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // This function computes the maximum possible sum of medians 
    // when dividing the array into (n - 1) / 2 disjoint triplets
    long long maximumMedianSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        long long totalMedianSum = 0;

        // Sort the array in non-decreasing order so we can choose medians optimally
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // We want to pick the second-largest number in each triplet to maximize the median sum.
        // These optimal medians are located at positions: n-2, n-4, ..., up to > i
        // where i increments forward and j moves backward by 2
        for (int i = 0, j = n - 2; i < j; ++i, j -= 2) {
            totalMedianSum += nums[j];  // Add the chosen median to the result
        }

        return totalMedianSum;
    }
};
```
