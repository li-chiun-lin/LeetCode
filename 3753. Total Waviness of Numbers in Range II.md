# Hard

You are given two integers $num1$ and $num2$ representing an inclusive range $[num1, num2]$.

The waviness of a number is defined as the total count of its peaks and valleys:

- A digit is a peak if it is strictly greater than both of its immediate neighbors.
- A digit is a valley if it is strictly less than both of its immediate neighbors.
- The first and last digits of a number cannot be peaks or valleys.
- Any number with fewer than 3 digits has a waviness of 0.

Return the total sum of waviness for all numbers in the range $[num1, num2]$.
