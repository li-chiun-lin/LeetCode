# Hard

You have $k$ bags. You are given a 0-indexed integer array $weights$ where $weights[i]$ is the weight of the $i$-th marble. You are also given the integer $k$.

Divide the marbles into the $k$ bags according to the following rules:

- No bag is empty.
- If the $i$-th marble and $j$-th marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the $i$-th and $j$-th indices should also be in that same bag.
- If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from $i$ to $j$ inclusively, then the cost of the bag is $weights[i] + weights[j]$.

The score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the $k$ bags.

Return the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long putMarbles(vector<int>& weights, int k) {
        int n = weights.size();
        vector<int> cost;
        
        // for each possible split position, 
        // if we split the array at position i, 
        // than the overall cost will increase with weights[i - 1] and weights[i],
        // for weights[i - 1] will be the right end of the previous bag, 
        // and weights[i] will be the left end of the next bag.
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            cost.push_back(weights[i - 1] + weights[i]);
        
        // since we have the quantities  ties of increasement of each possible split position,
        // we only have to find the largest k cost and the smallest k cost,
        // than we have our answer. 
        sort(begin(cost), end(cost));
        
        long long ma = 0;
        long long mi = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i + 1 < k && i < cost.size(); ++i)
        {
            ma += cost[n - 2 - i];
            mi += cost[i];
        }
        
        return ma - mi;
    }
};
```
