# Easy

Given an integer $n$ and an integer array $rounds$. We have a circular track which consists of $n$ sectors labeled from $1$ to $n$. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of $m$ rounds. The $i$-th round starts at sector $rounds[i - 1]$ and ends at sector $rounds[i]$.

Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostVisited(int n, vector<int>& rounds) {
        vector<int> ret;
        
        int s = rounds[0] - 1;
        int e = rounds.back() - 1;
        
        if (s > e)
        {
            while (s < n)
                ret.push_back(++ s);
            
            s = 0;
        }
        
        while (s <= e)
            ret.push_back(++ s);
        
        sort(ret.begin(), ret.end());
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
