# Easy

Given an integer array $nums$ of positive integers, return the average value of all even integers that are divisible by $3$.

Note that the average of $n$ elements is the sum of the $n$ elements divided by $n$ and rounded down to the nearest integer.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int averageValue(vector<int>& nums) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int x : nums)
        {
            if (x % 6 == 0)
            {
                sum += x;
                ++ cnt;
            }
        }
        
        return cnt ? sum / cnt : 0;
    }
};
```
