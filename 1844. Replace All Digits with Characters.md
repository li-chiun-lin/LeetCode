# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed string **s** that has lowercase English letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices.

There is a function **shift(c, x)**, where **c** is a character and **x** is a digit, that returns the **x**-th character after **c**.

For every odd index **i**, you want to replace the digit **s[i]** with **shift(s[i-1], s[i])**.

Return **s** after replacing all digits. It is guaranteed that **shift(s[i-1], s[i])** will never exceed **'z'**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string replaceDigits(string s) {
        for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i += 2)
            s[i] = s[i - 1] + (s[i] - '0');
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
