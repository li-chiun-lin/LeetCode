# Hard

A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a $grid$ of size $rows \times cols$, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

- Players are represented by the characters 'C'(Cat),'M'(Mouse).
- Floors are represented by the character '.' and can be walked on.
- Walls are represented by the character '#' and cannot be walked on.
- Food is represented by the character 'F' and can be walked on.
- There is only one of each character 'C', 'M', and 'F' in $grid$.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:

- Mouse moves first, then they take turns to move.
- During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the $grid$.
- $catJump, mouseJump$ are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.
- Staying in the same position is allowed.
- Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:

- If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.
- If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.
- If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.
- If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

Given a $rows \times cols$ matrix $grid$ and two integers $catJump$ and $mouseJump$, return $true$ if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return $false$.
