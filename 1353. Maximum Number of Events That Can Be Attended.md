# Medium

You are given an array of $events$ where $events[i] = [startDay_i, endDay_i]$. Every event $i$ starts at $startDay_i$ and ends at $endDay_i$.

You can attend an event $i$ at any day $d$ where $startTime_i \leq d \leq endTime_i$. You can only attend one event at any time $d$.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        // Step 1: Sort events by their start day
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());

        // Step 2: Use a min-heap (priority queue) to store event end days
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<>> minHeap;

        int day = 1;
        int eventIndex = 0;
        int totalEvents = events.size();
        int attended = 0;

        // Step 3: Loop through days up to the last possible event day
        // We loop as long as there are unprocessed events or pending events in the heap
        while (eventIndex < totalEvents || !minHeap.empty()) {
            // If the heap is empty, fast forward to the next available event's start day
            if (minHeap.empty() && eventIndex < totalEvents)
                day = events[eventIndex][0];

            // Step 4: Add all events starting on this day to the heap
            while (eventIndex < totalEvents && events[eventIndex][0] == day) {
                minHeap.push(events[eventIndex][1]); // push end day
                ++eventIndex;
            }

            // Step 5: Remove events that have already expired
            while (!minHeap.empty() && minHeap.top() < day)
                minHeap.pop();

            // Step 6: Attend the event that ends earliest (greedy)
            if (!minHeap.empty()) {
                minHeap.pop();  // Attend this event
                ++attended;     // Count it
            }

            // Move to the next day
            ++day;
        }

        return attended;
    }
};
