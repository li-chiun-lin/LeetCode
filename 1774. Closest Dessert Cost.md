You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have **n** ice cream base flavors and **m** types of toppings to choose from. You must follow these rules when making your dessert:

- There must be exactly one ice cream base.
- You can add one or more types of topping or have no toppings at all.
- There are at most two of each type of topping.

You are given three inputs:

- **baseCosts**, an integer array of length **n**, where each **baseCosts[i]** represents the price of the **i**-th ice cream base flavor.
- **toppingCosts**, an integer array of length **m**, where each **toppingCosts[i]** is the price of one of the **i**-th topping.
- **target**, an integer representing your target price for dessert.

You want to make a dessert with a total cost as close to **target** as possible.

Return the closest possible cost of the dessert to **target**. If there are multiple, return the lower one.

```cpp
class Solution {
    void comb(vector<int>& cost, int i, int acc, set<int> &tc)
    {
        if (i < 0)
        {
            tc.insert(acc);
            return ;
        }
        
        // do not add topping i
        comb(cost, i - 1, acc, tc);
        // add one topping i
        comb(cost, i - 1, acc + cost[i], tc);
        // add two topping i
        comb(cost, i - 1, acc + cost[i] + cost[i], tc);
    }

public:
    int closestCost(vector<int>& baseCosts, vector<int>& toppingCosts, int target) {
        int m = toppingCosts.size();
        set<int> tc;
        
        // find all possible combination of topping costs.
        comb(toppingCosts, m - 1, 0, tc);
        
        int mm = INT_MAX;
        int ret = 0;
        
        // for each ice cream base
        for (int b : baseCosts)
        {
            auto it = tc.lower_bound(target - b);
            int d = 0;
            int cost = 0;
            
            // check with next larger topping cost combination
            if (it != tc.end())
            {
                cost = b + *it;
                d = abs(cost - target);
            
                if (mm > d || (mm == d && ret > cost))
                {
                    mm = d;
                    ret = cost;
                }
            }
            
            // check with the next maller one
            if (it -- != tc.begin())
            {
                cost = b + *it;
                d = abs(cost - target);

                if (mm > d || (mm == d && ret > cost))
                {
                    mm = d;
                    ret = cost;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
