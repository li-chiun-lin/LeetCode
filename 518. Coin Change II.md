You are given an integer array $coins$ representing coins of different denominations and an integer $amount$ representing a total amount of money.

Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return $0$.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        int n = coins.size();
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1);
        
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; ++j)
                dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
        
        return dp[amount];
    }
};
```
