The k-beauty of an integer **num** is defined as the number of substrings of **num** when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:

- It has a length of **k**.
- It is a divisor of **num**.

Given integers **num** and **k**, return the k-beauty of **num**.

Note:

- Leading zeros are allowed.
- **0** is not a divisor of any value.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int divisorSubstrings(int num, int k) {
        int nn = num;
        // this could be dangerous if we encounter larger k
        long long mm = pow(10, k);
        int cnt = 0;
        
        // we start from right to left,
        // in each iteration, we get the rightest k digits by modulo
        // and then we shift the nn one dight to the right
        // until there are no more than k digits.
        while (nn >= mm / 10)
        {
            int d = nn % mm;
            
            // avoid divided by 0
            if (d)
                cnt += num % d == 0;
            
            nn /= 10;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
