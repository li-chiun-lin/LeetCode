Given an array of integers $citations$ where $citations[i]$ is the number of citations a researcher received for their $i$-th paper and $citations$ is sorted in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's $h$-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index $h$ if $h$ of their $n$ papers have at least $h$ citations each, and the other $n âˆ’ h$ papers have no more than $h$ citations each.

If there are several possible values for $h$, the maximum one is taken as the $h$-index.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        int l = 0;
        int r = n - 1;
        int m = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        
        while (l <= r)
        {
            m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            
            if (citations[m] > n - 1 - m)
            {
                ret = m;
                r = m - 1;
            }
            else
                l = m + 1;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
