# Medium

You are given a positive integer $n$ representing $n$ cities numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are also given a 2D array $roads$ where $roads[i] = [a_i, b_i, distance_i]$ indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities $a_i$ and $b_i$ with a distance equal to $distance_i$. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.

Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities $1$ and $n$.

Note:

- A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
- It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities $1$ and $n$ multiple times along the path.
- The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between $1$ and $n$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int find(int x, vector<int>& grp)
    {
        int gx = grp[x];
        
        while (gx != grp[gx])
            gx = find(grp[gx], grp);
        
        // update the group id of x for quicker finding next time.
        return grp[x] = gx;
    }
    
    void join(int x, int y, int dst, vector<int>& grp, vector<int>& score)
    {
        int gx = find(x, grp);
        int gy = find(y, grp);
        
        // use x as major for no reason.
        score[gx] = min(score[gx], dst);
        
        if (gx == gy)
            return ;
        
        // the group of y might contain a better score.
        score[gx] = min(score[gx], score[gy]);
        grp[gy] = gx;
    }
    
public:
    int minScore(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        vector<int> grp(n + 1), score(n + 1, INT_MAX);
        
        iota(begin(grp), end(grp), 0);
        
        for (auto& r : roads)
            join(r[0], r[1], r[2], grp, score);
        
        return score[find(n, grp)];
    }
