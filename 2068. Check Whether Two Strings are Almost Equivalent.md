Two strings **word1** and **word2** are considered almost equivalent if the differences between the frequencies of each letter **from 'a' to 'z'** between **word1** and **word2** is at most **3**.

Given two strings **word1** and **word2**, each of length **n**, return **true** if **word1** and **word2** are almost equivalent, or **false** otherwise.

The frequency of a letter **x** is the number of times it occurs in the string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkAlmostEquivalent(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<int> hist(26);
        
        for (char c : word1)
            ++ hist[c - 'a'];
        
        for (char c : word2)
            -- hist[c - 'a'];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
            if (abs(hist[i]) > 3)
                return false;
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
