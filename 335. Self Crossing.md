# Hard

You are given an array of integers $distance$.

You start at the point $(0, 0)$ on an X-Y plane, and you move $distance[0]$ meters to the north, then $distance[1]$ meters to the west, $distance[2]$ meters to the south, $distance[3]$ meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Return $true$ if your path crosses itself or $false$ if it does not.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSelfCrossing(vector<int>& distance) {
        int n = distance.size();
        int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, e = 0, f = 0;

        for (auto x : distance)
        {
            f = e;
            e = d;
            d = c;
            c = b;
            b = a;
            a = x;

            if (d >= b && b > 0 && (a >= c || a >= c - e && c >= e && f >= d - b))
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```
