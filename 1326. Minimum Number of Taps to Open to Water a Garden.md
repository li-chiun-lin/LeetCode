# Hard

There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point $0$ and ends at the point $n$. (i.e The length of the garden is $n$).

There are $n + 1$ taps located at points $[0, 1, ..., n]$ in the garden.

Given an integer $n$ and an integer array ranges of length $n + 1$ where $ranges[i]$ (0-indexed) means the $i$-th tap can water the area $[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]$ if it was open.

Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTaps(int n, vector<int>& ranges) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> cover(n + 1);

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
            cover[i] = {i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]};

        sort(begin(cover), end(cover));

        int ret = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int i = 0;

        while (left < n && i <= n)
        {
            while (i <= n && cover[i].first <= left)
                right = max(right, cover[i ++].second);

            if (right <= left)
                return -1;

            left = right;
            ++ ret;
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
```
