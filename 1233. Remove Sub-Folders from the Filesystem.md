Given a list of folders $folder$, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.

If a $folder[i]$ is located within another $folder[j]$, it is called a sub-folder of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string>& folder) {
        // Sort folder paths lexicographically so that parent folders come before their subfolders
        sort(folder.begin(), folder.end());

        vector<string> result;
        result.push_back(folder[0]); // Always include the first folder (guaranteed to be a root)

        for (int i = 1; i < folder.size(); ++i) {
            const string& current = folder[i];
            const string& lastIncluded = result.back();

            // Check if current folder is a subfolder of the last added one
            // Must match prefix + '/' to avoid false positives (e.g., "/a" and "/ab")
            if (current.compare(0, lastIncluded.size(), lastIncluded) != 0 || current[lastIncluded.size()] != '/') {
                result.push_back(current); // Not a subfolder, add to result
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
