Given a list of folders $folder$, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.

If a $folder[i]$ is located within another $folder[j]$, it is called a sub-folder of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string>& folder) {
        
        sort(begin(folder), end(folder));
        
        vector<string> ret = {folder[0]};
        
        for (int i = 1; i < folder.size(); ++i)
            if (folder[i].substr(0, ret.back().size() + 1) != ret.back() + "/")
                ret.push_back(folder[i]);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
