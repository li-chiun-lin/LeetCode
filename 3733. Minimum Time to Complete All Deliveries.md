You are given two integer arrays of size 2: $d = [d_1, d_2]$ and $r = [r_1, r_2]$.

Two delivery drones are tasked with completing a specific number of deliveries. Drone $i$ must complete $d_i$ deliveries.

Each delivery takes exactly one hour and only one drone can make a delivery at any given hour.

Additionally, both drones require recharging at specific intervals during which they cannot make deliveries. Drone $i$ must recharge every $r_i$ hours (i.e. at hours that are multiples of $r_i$).

Return an integer denoting the minimum total time (in hours) required to complete all deliveries.
