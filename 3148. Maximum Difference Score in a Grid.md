# Medium

You are given an $m \times n$ matrix $grid$ consisting of positive integers. You can move from a cell in the matrix to any other cell that is either to the bottom or to the right (not necessarily adjacent). The score of a move from a cell with the value $c1$ to a cell with the value $c2$ is $c2 - c1$.

You can start at any cell, and you have to make at least one move.

Return the maximum total score you can achieve.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = size(grid);
        int n = size(grid[0]);
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, INT_MIN));
        int ans = INT_MIN;
        dp[m - 1][n - 1] = grid[m - 1][n - 1];

        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; --i)
            for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; --j)
                if (i != m - 1 || j != n - 1)
                {
                    int ub = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]);
                    dp[i][j] = max(grid[i][j], ub);
                    ans = max(ans, ub - grid[i][j]);
                }
            
        return ans;
    }
};
