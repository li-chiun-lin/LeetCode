# Easy

You are given an integer array $gifts$ denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:

- Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
- If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
- Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.

Return the number of gifts remaining after $k$ seconds.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long pickGifts(vector<int>& gifts, int k) {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        
        for (int g : gifts)
            pq.push(g);
        
        while (k --)
        {
            auto t = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(sqrt(t));
        }
        
        long long ret = 0;
        
        while (pq.size())
        {
            ret += pq.top();
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
