# Easy

You are given an integer array $gifts$ denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:

- Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
- If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
- Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.

Return the number of gifts remaining after $k$ seconds.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long pickGifts(vector<int>& gifts, int k) {
        // Create a max-heap (priority queue) to easily access the largest gift
        priority_queue<int> pq;

        // Add all gifts to the priority queue
        for (int gift : gifts) {
            pq.push(gift);
        }

        // Perform k operations of taking the largest gift and replacing it with its square root
        while (k--) {
            int topGift = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(sqrt(topGift));
        }

        // Sum all remaining gifts in the priority queue
        long long total = 0;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            total += pq.top();
            pq.pop();
        }

        return total;
    }
};
```
