You are given an array $complexity$ of length $n$.

There are $n$ locked computers in a room with labels from $0$ to $n - 1$, each with its own unique password. The password of the computer $i$ has a complexity $complexity[i]$.

The password for the computer labeled $0$ is already decrypted and serves as the root. All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer, following this information:

- You can decrypt the password for the computer $i$ using the password for computer $j$, where $j$ is any integer less than $i$ with a lower complexity.
- To decrypt the password for computer $i$, you must have already unlocked a computer $j$ such that $j < i$ and $complexity[j] < complexity[i]$.

Find the number of permutations of $[0, 1, 2, ..., (n - 1)]$ that represent a valid order in which the computers can be unlocked, starting from computer $0$ as the only initially unlocked one.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

Note that the password for the computer with label $0$ is decrypted, and not the computer with the first position in the permutation.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPermutations(vector<int>& complexity) {
        const int n = complexity.size();
        const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

        // Check constraint: All computers except the first must have higher complexity.
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (complexity[i] <= complexity[0]) {
                return 0;  // Invalid unlock order
            }
        }

        // If valid, number of ways to order the remaining (n - 1) computers is (n - 1)!
        long long result = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
            result = result * i % mod;
        }

        return static_cast<int>(result);
    }
};
```
