# Easy

You are given a string $s$ of lowercase English letters and an array $widths$ denoting how many pixels wide each lowercase English letter is.

You are trying to write $s$ across several lines, where each line is no longer than $100$ pixels. Starting at the beginning of $s$, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed $100$ pixels. Then, from where you stopped in $s$, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of $s$.

Return an array $result$ of length $2$ where:

- $result[0]$ is the total number of lines.
- $result[1]$ is the width of the last line in pixels.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numberOfLines(vector<int>& widths, string s) {
        int line = 0;
        int wid = 0;
        
        for (char c : s)
        {
            int w = widths[c - 'a'];
            wid += w;
            
            if (wid > 100)
            {
                ++ line;
                wid = w;
            }
        }
        
        return {line + 1, wid};
    }
};
```
