# Easy

You are given an integer array $score$ of size $n$, where $score[i]$ is the score of the $i$-th athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.

The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the $1$-st place athlete has the highest score, the $2$-nd place athlete has the $2$-nd highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

- The $1$-st place athlete's rank is **"Gold Medal"**.
- The $2$-nd place athlete's rank is **"Silver Medal"**.
- The $3$-rd place athlete's rank is **"Bronze Medal"**.
- For the $4$-th place to the $n$-th place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the $x$-th place athlete's rank is **"x"**).

Return an array $answer$ of size $n$ where $answer[i]$ is the rank of the $i$-th athlete.

public:
    vector<string> findRelativeRanks(vector<int>& score) {
        map<int, int> idx_sco;
        map<int, int> sco_ran;
        vector<string> ret(score.size());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < score.size(); ++i)
            idx_sco[i] = score[i];
        
        sort(score.begin(), score.end(), greater<int>());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < score.size(); ++i)
            sco_ran[score[i]] = i;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < score.size(); ++i)
        {
            int rank = sco_ran[idx_sco[i]];
            if (rank == 0)
                ret[i] = "Gold Medal";
            else if (rank == 1)
                ret[i] = "Silver Medal";
            else if (rank == 2)
                ret[i] = "Bronze Medal";
            else
                ret[i] = to_string(rank + 1);
        }
        
        return ret;
