You are given a string $s$ of length $m$ consisting of digits. You are also given a 2D integer array $queries$, where $queries[i] = [l_i, r_i]$.

For each $queries[i]$, extract the substring $s[l_i..r_i]$. Then, perform the following:

- Form a new integer $x$ by concatenating all the non-zero digits from the substring in their original order. If there are no non-zero digits, $x = 0$.
- Let $sum$ be the sum of digits in $x$. The answer is $x \times sum$.

Return an array of integers $answer$ where $answer[i]$ is the answer to the $i$-th query.

Since the answers may be very large, return them modulo $10^9 + 7$.
