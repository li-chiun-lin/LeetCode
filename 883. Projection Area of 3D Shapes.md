# Easy

You are given an $n \times n$ $grid$ where we place some $1 \times 1 \times 1$ cubes that are axis-aligned with the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes.

Each value $v = grid[i] [j]$ represents a tower of $v$ cubes placed on top of the cell $(i, j)$.

We view the projection of these cubes onto the $xy$, $yz$, and $zx$ planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3-dimensional figure to a 2-dimensional plane. We are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int projectionArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                ret += grid[i][j] > 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
        {
            int m = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
                m = max(m, grid[i][j]);
            
            ret += m;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int m = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                m = max(m, grid[i][j]);
            
            ret += m;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
