Alice and Bob continue their games with stones. There is a row of n stones, and each stone has an associated value. You are given an integer array $stones$, where $stones[i]$ is the value of the $i$-th stone.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each turn, the player may remove any stone from $stones$. The player who removes a stone loses if the sum of the values of all removed stones is divisible by $3$. Bob will win automatically if there are no remaining stones (even if it is Alice's turn).

Assuming both players play optimally, return $true$ if Alice wins and $false$ if Bob wins.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool stoneGameIX(vector<int>& stones) {
        vector<int> cnt(3);

        for (auto x : stones)
            ++ cnt[x % 3];

        return cnt[1] == 0 || cnt[2] == 0
            ? max(cnt[1], cnt[2]) > 2 && cnt[0] % 2 == 1
            : abs(cnt[1] - cnt[2]) > 2 || cnt[0] % 2 == 0;
    }
};
```
