You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer $k$. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array $logs$ where each $logs[i] = [ID_i, time_i]$ indicates that the user with $ID_i$ performed an action at the minute $time_i$.

Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.

The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array $answer$ of size $k$ such that, for each $j (1 \leq j \leq k)$, $answer[j]$ is the number of users whose UAM equals $j$.

Return the array answer as described above.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findingUsersActiveMinutes(vector<vector<int>>& logs, int k) {
        map<int, set<int>> hit;
        vector<int> ret(k);
        
        for (auto &l : logs)
            hit[l[0]].insert(l[1]);
        
        for (auto &h : hit)
            ++ ret[h.second.size() - 1];
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
