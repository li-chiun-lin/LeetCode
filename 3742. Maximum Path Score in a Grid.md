# Medium

You are given an $m \times n$ grid where each cell contains one of the values 0, 1, or 2. You are also given an integer $k$.

You start from the top-left corner $(0, 0)$ and want to reach the bottom-right corner $(m - 1, n - 1)$ by moving only right or down.

Each cell contributes a specific score and incurs an associated cost, according to their cell values:

- 0: adds 0 to your score and costs 0.
- 1: adds 1 to your score and costs 1.
- 2: adds 2 to your score and costs 1. ​​​​​​​

Return the maximum score achievable without exceeding a total cost of $k$, or $-1$ if no valid path exists.

Note: If you reach the last cell but the total cost exceeds $k$, the path is invalid.
