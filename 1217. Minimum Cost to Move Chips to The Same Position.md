# Easy

We have $n$ chips, where the position of the $i$-th chip is $position[i]$.

We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the $i$-th chip from $position[i]$ to:

- $position[i] + 2$ or $position[i] - 2$ with $cost = 0$.
- $position[i] + 1$ or $position[i] - 1$ with $cost = 1$.

Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostToMoveChips(vector<int>& position) {
        int cnt[2] = {0};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < position.size(); ++i)
            ++ cnt[position[i] % 2];
        
        return min(cnt[0], cnt[1]);
    }
};
```
