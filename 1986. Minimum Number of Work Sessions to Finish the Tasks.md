# Medium

There are **n** tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array **tasks** of length **n**, where the **i**-th task takes **tasks[i]** hours to finish. A work session is when you work for at most **sessionTime** consecutive hours and then take a break.

You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:

- If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the same work session.
- You can start a new task immediately after finishing the previous one.
- You may complete the tasks in any order.

Given **tasks** and **sessionTime**, return the minimum number of work sessions needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above.

The tests are generated such that **sessionTime** is greater than or equal to the maximum element in **tasks[i]**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(vector<int>& tasks, int sessionTime, int done, int t, vector<vector<int>> &dp)
    {
        if (dp[done][t] != -1)
            return dp[done][t];
        
        int n = tasks.size();
        
        // all tasks done
        if (done == (1 << n) - 1)
            return dp[done][t] = 0;
        
        int r = n;
        
        for (int i = 0, bit = 1; i < n; ++i, bit <<= 1)
        {
            if (done & bit)
                continue;
            
            if (t >= tasks[i])
                r = min(r, 
                    // in the same session
                    dfs(tasks, sessionTime, done | bit, t - tasks[i], dp));
            else
                r = min(r, 
                    // start a new session
                    dfs(tasks, sessionTime, done | bit, sessionTime - tasks[i], dp) + 1);
        }
        
        return dp[done][t] = r;
    }
    
    int minSessions(vector<int>& tasks, int sessionTime) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(1 << tasks.size(), vector<int>(sessionTime + 1, -1));
        return dfs(tasks, sessionTime, 0, 0, dp);
    }
};
