# Medium

There are $n$ people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a unique ID from $0$ to $n - 1$.

You are given an integer array $groupSizes$, where $groupSizes[i]$ is the size of the group that person $i$ is in.

Return a list of groups such that each person $i$ is in a group of size $groupSizes[i]$.

Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> groupThePeople(vector<int>& groupSizes) {
        int n = groupSizes.size();
        map<int, vector<int>> grp;
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            grp[groupSizes[i]].push_back(i);
        
        ret.push_back({});
        
        for (auto& p : grp)
        {
            int cnt = 0;
            
            for (int i : p.second)
            {
                ret.back().push_back(i);
                
                if (++ cnt == p.first)
                {
                    ret.push_back({});
                    cnt = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        while (ret.size() && ret.back().empty())
            ret.pop_back();
        
        return ret;
    }
};
