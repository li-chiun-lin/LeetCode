# Hard

You are given an undirected tree rooted at node $0$, with $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates an edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$.

You are also given an integer array $nums$ of length $n$, where $nums[i]$ represents the value at node $i$, and an integer $k$.

You may perform inversion operations on a subset of nodes subject to the following rules:

- Subtree Inversion Operation:
  - When you invert a node, every value in the subtree rooted at that node is multiplied by $-1$.
- Distance Constraint on Inversions:
  - You may only invert a node if it is "sufficiently far" from any other inverted node.
  - Specifically, if you invert two nodes $a$ and $b$ such that one is an ancestor of the other, then the distance (the number of edges on the unique path between them) must be at least $k$.

Return the maximum possible sum of the tree's node values after applying inversion operations.
