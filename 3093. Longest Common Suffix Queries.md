# Hard

You are given two arrays of strings $wordsContainer$ and $wordsQuery$.

For each $wordsQuery[i]$, you need to find a string from $wordsContainer$ that has the longest common suffix with $wordsQuery[i]$. If there are two or more strings in $wordsContainer$ that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the smallest in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the same smallest length, find the one that occurred earlier in $wordsContainer$.

Return an array of integers $ans$, where $ans[i]$ is the index of the string in $wordsContainer$ that has the longest common suffix with $wordsQuery[i]$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    struct trie
    {
        int idx;
        struct trie* next[26];
    };

public:
    vector<int> stringIndices(vector<string>& wordsContainer, vector<string>& wordsQuery) {
        auto join = [&](trie* obj, int i)
        {
            for (int j = size(wordsContainer[i]) - 1; j >= 0; --j)
            {
                int c = wordsContainer[i][j] - 'a';

                if (obj->next[c] == NULL)
                {
                    obj->next[c] = new trie();
                    obj->next[c]->idx = i;
                }

                obj = obj->next[c];

                if (size(wordsContainer[obj->idx]) > size(wordsContainer[i]))
                    obj->idx = i;
            }
        };

        auto query = [&](trie* obj, string& w)
        {
            int ans = obj->idx;

            for (int j = size(w) - 1; j >= 0 && obj->next[w[j] - 'a']; --j)
            {
                obj = obj->next[w[j] - 'a'];
                ans = obj->idx;
            }

            return ans;
        };

        int n = size(wordsContainer);
        int m = size(wordsQuery);
        vector<int> ans(m);
        trie* obj = new trie();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (size(wordsContainer[obj->idx]) > size(wordsContainer[i]))
                obj->idx = i;
                
            join(obj, i);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            ans[i] = query(obj, wordsQuery[i]);

        return ans;
    }
};
