# Easy

You are given a string $s$ consisting only of the characters '1' and '2'.

You may delete any number of characters from $s$ without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Return the largest possible resultant string that represents an even integer. If there is no such string, return the empty string "".

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string largestEven(string s) {
        while (size(s) && s.back() == '1')
            s.pop_back();

        return s;
    }
};
```
