# Easy

You are given two strings **s1** and **s2** of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return **true** if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return **false**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool areAlmostEqual(string s1, string s2) {
        vector<int> diff;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); ++i)
            if (s1[i] != s2[i])
                diff.push_back(i);
        
        if (diff.size() == 0)
            return true;
        
        if (diff.size() == 2 && s1[diff[0]] == s2[diff[1]] && s1[diff[1]] == s2[diff[0]])
            return true;
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
