# Easy

You are given an integer array $nums$ consisting of unique integers.

Originally, $nums$ contained every integer within a certain range. However, some integers might have gone missing from the array.

The smallest and largest integers of the original range are still present in $nums$.

Return a sorted list of all the missing integers in this range. If no integers are missing, return an empty list.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMissingElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = size(nums);
        vector<int> ans;

        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));

        int missing = nums[0];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            while (missing < nums[i])
            {
                ans.push_back(missing);
                ++ missing;
            }

            ++ missing;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
