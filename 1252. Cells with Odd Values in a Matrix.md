# Easy

There is an $m \times n$ matrix that is initialized to all $0$'s. There is also a 2D array $indices$ where each $indices[i] = [r_i, c_i]$ represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.

For each location $indices[i]$, do both of the following:

- Increment all the cells on row $r_i$.
- Increment all the cells on column $c_i$.

Given $m$, $n$, and $indices$, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in $indices$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int oddCells(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& indices) {
        vector<int> rr(m);
        vector<int> cc(n);
        
        for (auto &i : indices)
        {
            ++ rr[i[0]];
            ++ cc[i[1]];
        }
        
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                if ((rr[i] + cc[j]) % 2)
                    ++ cnt;
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
