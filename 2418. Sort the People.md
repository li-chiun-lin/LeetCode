# Easy

You are given an array of strings $names$, and an array $heights$ that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length $n$.

For each index $i$, $names[i]$ and $heights[i]$ denote the name and height of the $i$-th person.

Return $names$ sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> sortPeople(vector<string>& names, vector<int>& heights) {
        int n = names.size();
        vector<pair<int, string>> vec(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            vec[i] = {heights[i], names[i]};
        
        sort(begin(vec), end(vec), greater<>());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            names[i] = vec[i].second;
        
        return names;
    }
};
```
