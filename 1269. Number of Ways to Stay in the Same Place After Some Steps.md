# Hard

You have a pointer at index $0$ in an array of size $arrLen$. At each step, you can move 1 position to the left, 1 position to the right in the array, or stay in the same place (The pointer should not be placed outside the array at any time).

Given two integers $steps$ and $arrLen$, return the number of ways such that your pointer is still at index $0$ after exactly $steps$ steps. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(int steps, int arrLen) {
        int n = min(steps / 2 + 1, arrLen);
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<long long>> dp(2, vector<long long>(n + 2));
        int cur = 1;
        int pre = 0;

        dp[pre][1] = 1;

        while (steps --)
        {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
                dp[cur][i] = (dp[pre][i] + dp[pre][i - 1] + dp[pre][i + 1]) % mod;

            cur = pre;
            pre = 1 - cur;
        }

        return dp[pre][1];
    }
};
```
