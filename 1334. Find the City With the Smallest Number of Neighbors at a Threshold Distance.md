# Medium

There are $n$ cities numbered from $0$ to $n-1$. Given the array $edges$ where $edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]$ represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities $from_i$ and $to_i$, and given the integer $distanceThreshold$.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most $distanceThreshold$, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities $i$ and $j$ is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheCity(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int distanceThreshold) {
        vector<vector<int>> dist(n, vector<int>(n, 10001));
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            dist[e[0]][e[1]] = e[2];
            dist[e[1]][e[0]] = e[2];
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            dist[i][i] = 0;
        
        for (int mid = 0; mid < n; ++mid)
            for (int src = 0; src < n; ++src)
                for (int dst = 0; dst < n; ++ dst)
                    dist[src][dst] = min(dist[src][dst], dist[src][mid] + dist[mid][dst]);
        
        int ret = 0;
        int m = n;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int cnt = 0;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                if (dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold)
                    ++ cnt;
            
            if (cnt <= m)
            {
                ret = i;
                m = cnt;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
