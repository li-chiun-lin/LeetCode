A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

You are given an array of strings **sentences**, where each **sentences[i]** represents a single sentence.

Return the **maximum** number of words that appear in a single sentence.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mostWordsFound(vector<string>& sentences) {
        int m = 0;
        
        for (string &s : sentences)
        {
            stringstream ss(s);
            string tok;
            int c = 0;
            
            while (ss >> tok)
                ++ c;
            
            m = max(m, c);
        }
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
