# Easy

There is an undirected star graph consisting of **n** nodes labeled **from 1 to n**. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly **n - 1** edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array **edges** where each **edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]** indicates that there is an edge between the nodes **u<sub>i</sub>** and **v<sub>i</sub>**. Return the center of the given star graph.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCenter(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        map<int, int> oe;
        
        for (auto &e : edges)
        {
            ++ oe[e[0]];
            ++ oe[e[1]];
        }
        
        for (auto &o : oe)
            if (o.second == oe.size() - 1)
                return o.first;
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```
