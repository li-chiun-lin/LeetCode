You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer $n$ which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array $edges$, where each $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates that there is an undirected edge between $u_i$ and $v_i$.

A connected trio is a set of three nodes where there is an edge between every pair of them.

The degree of a connected trio is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.

Return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or $-1$ if the graph has no connected trios.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTrioDegree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<set<int>> adj(n + 1);
        vector<int> deg(n + 1);
        int ans = INT_MAX;

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[min(e[0], e[1])].insert(max(e[0], e[1]));
            ++ deg[e[0]];
            ++ deg[e[1]];
        }

        for (auto t1 = 1; t1 <= n; ++t1)
            for (auto it2 = begin(adj[t1]); it2 != end(adj[t1]); ++it2)
                for (auto it3 = next(it2); it3 != end(adj[t1]); ++it3)
                    if (adj[*it2].count(*it3))
                        ans = min(ans, deg[t1] + deg[*it2] + deg[*it3] - 6);

        return ans == INT_MAX ? -1 : ans;
    }
};
