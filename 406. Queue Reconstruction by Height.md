# Medium

You are given an array of people, $people$, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each $people[i] = [h_i, k_i]$ represents the $i$-th person of height $h_i$ with exactly $k_i$ other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to $h_i$.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array $people$. The returned queue should be formatted as an array $queue$, where $queue[j] = [h_j, k_j]$ is the attributes of the $j$-th person in the queue ($queue[0]$ is the person at the front of the queue).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        int n = people.size();
        vector<vector<int>> ret(n);
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int c = people[i][1];
            int j = 0;
            
            while (j < n)
            {
                if (ret[j].size() == 0 || ret[j][0] == people[i][0])
                {
                    if (c -- == 0)
                    {
                        ret[j] = people[i];
                        break;
                    }
                }
                
                ++ j;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
