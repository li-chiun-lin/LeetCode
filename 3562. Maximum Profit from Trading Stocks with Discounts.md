# Hard

You are given an integer $n$, representing the number of employees in a company. Each employee is assigned a unique ID from $1$ to $n$, and employee $1$ is the CEO. You are given two 1-based integer arrays, $present$ and $future$, each of length $n$, where:

- $present[i]$ represents the current price at which the $i$-th employee can buy a stock today.
- $future[i]$ represents the expected price at which the $i$-th employee can sell the stock tomorrow.

The company's hierarchy is represented by a 2D integer array $hierarchy$, where $hierarchy[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ means that employee $u_i$ is the direct boss of employee $v_i$.

Additionally, you have an integer $budget$ representing the total funds available for investment.

However, the company has a discount policy: if an employee's direct boss purchases their own stock, then the employee can buy their stock at half the original price $(floor(present[v] / 2))$.

Return the maximum profit that can be achieved without exceeding the given budget.

Note:

- You may buy each stock at most once.
- You cannot use any profit earned from future stock prices to fund additional investments and must buy only from $budget$.
