# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array $nums$ and a positive integer $diff$. A triplet $(i, j, k)$ is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

- $i < j < k$,
- $nums[j] - nums[i] == diff$, and
- $nums[k] - nums[j] == diff$.

Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arithmeticTriplets(vector<int>& nums, int diff) {
        set<int> ss(begin(nums), end(nums));
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int x : ss)
            if (ss.count(x - diff) && ss.count(x + diff))
                ++ cnt;
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
