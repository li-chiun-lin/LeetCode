# Medium

Alice has $n$ balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string $colors$ where $colors[i]$ is the color of the $i$-th balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array $neededTime$ where $neededTime[i]$ is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the $i$-th balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
        int ret = 0;
        int n = colors.size();
        
        char last_color = colors[0];
        int last_idx = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            // if we encounter two consecutive ballons with same color, 
            if (last_color == colors[i])
            {
                // if remove the earlier one takes more time, 
                if (neededTime[last_idx] > neededTime[i])
                {
                    // we remove the latter ballon, 
                    ret += neededTime[i];
                }
                else
                {
                    // or otherwise we remove the earlier one, 
                    ret += neededTime[last_idx];
                    // and set the latter one for next comparison.
                    last_idx = i;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                // ballon with different color? good, keep it.
                last_color = colors[i];
                last_idx = i;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
