# Hard

You are given an integer $n$ and a 2D integer array $queries$.

There are $n$ cities numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. Initially, there is a unidirectional road from city $i$ to city $i + 1$ for all $0 \leq i < n - 1$.

$queries[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ represents the addition of a new unidirectional road from city $u_i$ to city $v_i$. After each query, you need to find the length of the shortest path from city $0$ to city $n - 1$.

There are no two queries such that $queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1]$.

Return an array $answer$ where for each $i$ in the range $[0, queries.length - 1]$, $answer[i]$ is the length of the shortest path from city $0$ to city $n - 1$ after processing the first $i + 1$ queries.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestDistanceAfterQueries(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> ans;
        set<int> ss;

        auto merge = [&](int l, int r)
        {
            ss.erase(ss.lower_bound(l + 1), ss.upper_bound(r - 1));
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ss.insert(i);

        for (auto& q : queries)
        {
            merge(q[0], q[1]);
            ans.push_back(size(ss) - 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
