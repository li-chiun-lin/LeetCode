You are given two positive 0-indexed integer arrays $nums1$ and $nums2$, both of length $n$.

The sum of squared difference of arrays $nums1$ and $nums2$ is defined as the sum of $(nums1[i] - nums2[i])^2$ for each $0 \leq i < n$.

You are also given two positive integers $k1$ and $k2$. You can modify any of the elements of $nums1$ by $+1$ or $-1$ at most $k1$ times. Similarly, you can modify any of the elements of $nums2$ by $+1$ or $-1$ at most $k2$ times.

Return the minimum sum of squared difference after modifying array $nums1$ at most $k1$ times and modifying array $nums2$ at most $k2$ times.

You are allowed to modify the array elements to become negative integers.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minSumSquareDiff(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k1, int k2) {
        int n = nums1.size();
        int lim = 0;
        map<int, int> dif;
        int d = 0;
        
        // we find each abs, keep the count and find the max difference.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            d = abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
            ++ dif[d];
            lim = max(lim, d);
        }
        
        // it makes no difference between k1 and k2
        int k = k1 + k2;
        
        // we start from the max difference
        while (lim && k)
        {
            int m = min(dif[lim], k);
            
            // spend m steps to move m items from group (lim) to group (lim - 1)
            dif[lim] -= m;
            k -= m;
            dif[-- lim] += m;
        }
        
        // there might be some item left in the group (lim + 1)
        ++ lim;
        
        // collect the remaining.
        long long ret = 0;
        
        while (lim)
        {
            ret += (long long)dif[lim] * lim * lim;
            -- lim;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
