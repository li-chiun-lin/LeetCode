You have two types of tiles: a $2 \times 1$ domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.

Given an integer $n$, return the number of ways to tile an $2 \times n$ board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTilings(int n) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        // Ensure the dp vector has at least 4 elements to cover base cases
        vector<long long> dp(max(n + 1, 4), 0);

        // Base cases:
        dp[1] = 1;  // Only one way: a single vertical domino
        dp[2] = 2;  // Two ways: two vertical dominoes or two horizontal dominoes
        dp[3] = 5;  // Five tiling configurations (as precomputed)

        // dp[i] = 2 * dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 3]
        // This recurrence handles the domino and tromino placement combinations
        for (int i = 4; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = (2 * dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 3]) % MOD;
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
