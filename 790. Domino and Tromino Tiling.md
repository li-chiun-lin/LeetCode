# Medium

You have two types of tiles: a $2 \times 1$ domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.

Given an integer $n$, return the number of ways to tile an $2 \times n$ board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTilings(int n) {
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<long long> dp(max(n + 1, 4));
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        dp[3] = 5;

        for (int i = 4; i <= n; ++i)
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * 2 + dp[i - 3]) % mod;

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
