# Easy

You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened on the same day, $event1$ and $event2$, where:

- $event1 = [startTime_1, endTime_1]$ and
- $event2 = [startTime_2, endTime_2]$.

Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of $HH:MM$.

A conflict happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).

Return $true$ if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool haveConflict(vector<string>& event1, vector<string>& event2) {
        return event1[1] >= event2[0] && event2[1] >= event1[0];
    }
};
```
