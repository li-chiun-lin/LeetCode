LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an alert if any worker uses the key-card three or more times in a one-hour period.

You are given a list of strings $keyName$ and $keyTime$ where $[keyName[i], keyTime[i]]$ corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used in a single day.

Access times are given in the 24-hour time format $"HH:MM"$, such as $"23:51"$ and $"09:49"$.

Return a list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use. Sort the names in ascending order alphabetically.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int toTime(string &s)
    {
        int h = (s[0] - '0') * 10 + (s[1] - '0');
        int m = (s[3] - '0') * 10 + (s[4] - '0');
        
        return h * 60 + m;
    }
    
public:
    vector<string> alertNames(vector<string>& keyName, vector<string>& keyTime) {
        int n = keyName.size();
        vector<pair<int, string>> vec(n);
        map<string, vector<int>> hit;
        vector<string> ret;
        
        // hashmap, collect the keyTime for each keyName.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            hit[keyName[i]].push_back(toTime(keyTime[i]));
        
        for (auto &h : hit)
        {
            if (h.second.size() < 3)
                continue;

            sort(begin(h.second), end(h.second));
            
            // sliding window
            int j = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < h.second.size(); ++i)
            {
                while (h.second[i] - h.second[j] > 60)
                    ++ j;
                
                if (i - j >= 2)
                {
                    ret.push_back(h.first);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
