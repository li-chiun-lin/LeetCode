# Medium

You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array $properties$ where $properties[i] = [attack_i, defense_i]$ represents the properties of the $i$-th character in the game.

A character is said to be weak if any other character has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character $i$ is said to be weak if there exists another character $j$ where $attack_j > attack_i$ and $defense_j > defense_i$.

Return the number of weak characters.

```cpp
class cmp
{
public:
    bool operator()(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b)
    {
        return a[0] == b[0]
            ? (a[1] > b[1])
            : (a[0] < b[0]);
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWeakCharacters(vector<vector<int>>& properties) {
        sort(begin(properties), end(properties), cmp());
        int m = INT_MIN;
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int i = properties.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            if (properties[i][1] < m)
                ++ ret;
            else
                m = properties[i][1];
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
