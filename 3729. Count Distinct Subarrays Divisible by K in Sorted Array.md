# Hard

You are given an integer array $nums$ sorted in non-descending order and a positive integer $k$.

A subarray of $nums$ is good if the sum of its elements is divisible by $k$.

Return an integer denoting the number of distinct good subarrays of $nums$.

Subarrays are distinct if their sequences of values are. For example, there are 3 distinct subarrays in $[1, 1, 1]$, namely $[1]$, $[1, 1]$, and $[1, 1, 1]$.
