# Easy

Given two strings $s$ and $t$, return $true$ if $s$ is a subsequence of $t$, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < t.length(); ++j)
            if (s[i] == t[j])
                ++ i;
        
        return i == s.length();
    }
};
```
