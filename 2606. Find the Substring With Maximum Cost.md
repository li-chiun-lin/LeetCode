# Medium

You are given a string $s$, a string $chars$ of distinct characters and an integer array $vals$ of the same length as $chars$.

The cost of the substring is the sum of the values of each character in the substring. The cost of an empty string is considered $0$.

The value of the character is defined in the following way:

- If the character is not in the string $chars$, then its value is its corresponding position (1-indexed) in the alphabet.
- Otherwise, assuming $i$ is the index where the character occurs in the string $chars$, then its value is $vals[i]$.

Return the maximum cost among all substrings of the string $s$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumCostSubstring(string s, string chars, vector<int>& vals) {
        vector<int> v(26);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
            v[i] = i + 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.size(); ++i)
            v[chars[i] - 'a'] = vals[i];
        
        int loc = 0;
        int glo = 0;
        
        for (char c : s)
        {
            loc = max(v[c - 'a'], loc + v[c - 'a']);
            glo = max(glo, loc);
        }
        
        return glo;
    }
};
```
