You are given a 2D string array $responses$ where each $responses[i]$ is an array of strings representing survey responses from the $i$-th day.

Return the most common response across all days after removing duplicate responses within each $responses[i]$. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically smallest response.

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    string findCommonResponse(vector<vector<string>>& responses)
    {
        // Map to count the frequency of each unique response
        map<string, int> frequencyMap;

        // Iterate over each participant's responses
        for (auto& responseList : responses)
        {
            // Use a set to ensure no duplicate responses from the same participant
            set<string> uniqueResponses(begin(responseList), end(responseList));

            // Increment the frequency count for each unique response
            for (auto& response : uniqueResponses)
            {
                ++frequencyMap[response];
            }
        }

        int maxCount = 0;    // Maximum frequency found so far
        string answer = "";  // The response with the maximum frequency

        // Find the response with the highest frequency
        // If there is a tie, choose the lexicographically smaller response
        for (auto& [response, count] : frequencyMap)
        {
            if (maxCount < count || (maxCount == count && answer > response))
            {
                answer = response;
                maxCount = count;
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
```
