# Easy

You are given a positive integer $n$. Each digit of $n$ has a sign according to the following rules:

- The most significant digit is assigned a positive sign.
- Each other digit has an opposite sign to its adjacent digits.

Return the sum of all digits with their corresponding sign.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int alternateDigitSum(int n) {
        int o = 0, e = 0, c = 0;

        while (n)
        {
            if (c)
                o += n % 10;
            else
                e += n % 10;

            n /= 10;
            c = 1 - c;
        }

        return c ? e - o : o - e;
    }
};
```
