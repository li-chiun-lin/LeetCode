You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$, and an integer $k$.

In one operation, you will:

- Take the two smallest integers $x$ and $y$ in $nums$.
- Remove $x$ and $y$ from $nums$.
- Add $\min(x, y) \times 2 + \max(x, y)$ anywhere in the array.

Note that you can only apply the described operation if $nums$ contains at least two elements.

Return the minimum number of operations needed so that all elements of the array are greater than or equal to $k$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) 
    {
        // Min-heap (priority queue) to always process the smallest elements first
        priority_queue<long long, vector<long long>, greater<>> pq(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        int operations = 0; // Counter for the number of operations performed

        // Continue processing until there are at least two elements 
        // and the smallest element is less than k
        while (pq.size() >= 2 && pq.top() < k) 
        {
            // Extract the two smallest elements
            long long a = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            long long b = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            
            // Combine them using the operation: new_value = 2 * a + b
            pq.push(a * 2 + b);
            
            // Increment operation count
            operations++;
        }
        
        // Return the total number of operations required
        return operations;
    }
};
```
