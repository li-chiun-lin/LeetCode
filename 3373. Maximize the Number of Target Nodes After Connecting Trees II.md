# Hard

There exist two undirected trees with $n$ and $m$ nodes, labeled from $[0, n - 1]$ and $[0, m - 1]$, respectively.

You are given two 2D integer arrays $edges1$ and $edges2$ of lengths $n - 1$ and $m - 1$, respectively, where $edges1[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the first tree and $edges2[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$ in the second tree.

Node $u$ is target to node $v$ if the number of edges on the path from $u$ to $v$ is even. Note that a node is always target to itself.

Return an array of $n$ integers $answer$, where $answer[i]$ is the maximum possible number of nodes that are target to node $i$ of the first tree if you had to connect one node from the first tree to another node in the second tree.
