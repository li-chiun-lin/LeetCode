# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$. In one operation, you may do the following:

- Choose two integers in $nums$ that are equal.
- Remove both integers from $nums$, forming a pair.

The operation is done on $nums$ as many times as possible.

Return a 0-indexed integer array $answer$ of size $2$ where $answer[0]$ is the number of pairs that are formed and $answer[1]$ is the number of leftover integers in $nums$ after doing the operation as many times as possible.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numberOfPairs(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> hit;
        int cnt0 = 0;
        int cnt1 = 0;
        
        for (auto x : nums)
            ++ hit[x];
        
        for (auto &p : hit)
        {
            cnt0 += p.second / 2;
            cnt1 += p.second % 2;
        }
        
        return {cnt0, cnt1};
    }
};
```
