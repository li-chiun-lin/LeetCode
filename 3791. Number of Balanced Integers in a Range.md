# Hard

You are given two integers $low$ and $high$.

An integer is called balanced if it satisfies both of the following conditions:

- It contains at least two digits.
- The sum of digits at even positions is equal to the sum of digits at odd positions (the leftmost digit has position 1).

Return an integer representing the number of balanced integers in the range $[low, high]$ (both inclusive).
