You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$.

The effective value of three indices $i$, $j$, and $k$ is defined as $((nums[i] | nums[j]) \& nums[k])$.

The xor-beauty of the array is the XORing of the effective values of all the possible triplets of indices $(i, j, k)$ where $0 \leq i, j, k < n$.

Return the xor-beauty of $nums$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int xorBeauty(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        unsigned int mask = 1 << 31;
        int ret = 0;

        /*
        for every bit position, 
            assuming there are totally `b' set bits in all the `n' numbers,

            if nums[k] has a set bit,                                       (c1)
                if nums[i] or nums[j] any of them has a set bit, then       (c1-1)
                    the result of effective value will have a set bit.
                else, nums[i] and nums[j] none of them has a set bit, then  (c1-2)
                    the result will not have a set bit.
            else, nums[k] has no set bit,                                   (c2)
                the result will not have set bit.

            if the count of set bit of effective value is odd, then
                the beauty value will have a set bit.
            otherwise
                the beauty value will not have a set bit.

            so, we only have to count the set bit in (c1-1), then
            we know the set bit of the beauty value of this position.

            there are `b' set bits in (c1), and 
            there are n*n - [(n-b)*(n-b)] set bits in (c1-1), 
            hence, if b * {n*n - [(n-b)*(n-b)]} is odd, then
            the beauty value has a set bit.

            b * {n*n - [(n-b)*(n-b)]} can be simplify to 
            b * {(2n-b) * b}
            so we only have to check if b is odd and (2n-b) is odd.

        while (mask)
        {
            int b = 0;

            for (int x : nums)
                if (x & mask)
                    ++ b;

            int nnb = 2 * n - b;

            if (b % 2 && nnb % 2)
                ret |= mask;

            mask >>= 1;
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
