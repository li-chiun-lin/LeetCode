# Medium

You are given two integers $num1$ and $num2$ representing an inclusive range $[num1, num2]$.

The waviness of a number is defined as the total count of its peaks and valleys:

- A digit is a peak if it is strictly greater than both of its immediate neighbors.
- A digit is a valley if it is strictly less than both of its immediate neighbors.
- The first and last digits of a number cannot be peaks or valleys.
- Any number with fewer than 3 digits has a waviness of 0.

Return the total sum of waviness for all numbers in the range $[num1, num2]$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int count(int x)
    {
        int c = 0;

        if (x < 100)
            return 0;

        int d1 = x % 10;
        x /= 10;
        int d2 = x % 10;
        x /= 10;

        while (x)
        {
            int d3 = x % 10;
            x /= 10;

            if (d3 < d2 && d2 > d1)
                ++ c;
            else if (d3 > d2 && d2 < d1)
                ++ c;

            d1 = d2;
            d2 = d3;
        }

        return c;
    }

public:
    int totalWaviness(int num1, int num2) {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int x = num1; x <= num2; ++x)
            sum += count(x);

        return sum;
    }
};
```
