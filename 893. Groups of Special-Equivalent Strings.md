# Medium

You are given an array of strings of the same length $words$.

In one move, you can swap any two even indexed characters or any two odd indexed characters of a string $words[i]$.

Two strings $words[i]$ and $words[j]$ are special-equivalent if after any number of moves, $words[i] == words[j]$.

A group of special-equivalent strings from $words$ is a non-empty subset of words such that:

- Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and
- The group is the largest size possible.

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from words.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSpecialEquivGroups(vector<string>& words) {
        int m = words.size();
        int n = words[0].size();
        int h = (n + 1) / 2;
        set<string> ss;
        
        for (auto& w : words)
        {
            // swap all those even-indexed char to the front of `w'
            // and all those odd-indexed char to the back of `w'
            int l = 1;
            int r = n - 2 + (n % 2);
            
            while (l < r)
            {
                swap(w[l], w[r]);
                l += 2;
                r -= 2;
            }
            
            // sort the left half and right half of `w' separately.
            // so that if words[i] and word[j] are special-equivalent, 
            // they will become the same `w' after sorting.
            sort(begin(w), begin(w) + h);
            sort(begin(w) + h, end(w));
            
            // count the appearance of each special-equivalent class
            ss.insert(w);
        }

        return ss.size();
    }
};
