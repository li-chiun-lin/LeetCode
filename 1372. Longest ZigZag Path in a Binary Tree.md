You are given the $root$ of a binary tree.

A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

- Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
- If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.
- Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
- Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.

Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - $1$. (A single node has a length of $0$).

Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.

```cpp
class Solution {
    vector<int> dfs(TreeNode *root, int& m)
    {
        if (! root)
            return {-1, -1};
        
        auto l = dfs(root->left, m);
        auto r = dfs(root->right, m);
        
        m = max(max(l[1], r[0]) + 1, m);
        
        return {l[1] + 1, r[0] + 1};
    }
public:
    int longestZigZag(TreeNode* root) {
        int m = 0;
        
        auto ret = dfs(root, m);
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
