# Medium

A social media company is trying to monitor activity on their site by analyzing the number of tweets that occur in select periods of time. These periods can be partitioned into smaller time chunks based on a certain frequency (every minute, hour, or day).

Notice that the last chunk may be shorter than the specified frequency's chunk size and will always end with the end time of the period.

Design and implement an API to help the company with their analysis.

Implement the __TweetCounts__ class:

- __TweetCounts()__ Initializes the TweetCounts object.
- __void recordTweet(String tweetName, int time)__ Stores the $tweetName$ at the recorded $time$ (in seconds).
- __List\<Integer\> getTweetCountsPerFrequency(String freq, String tweetName, int startTime, int endTime)__ Returns a list of integers representing the number of tweets with $tweetName$ in each time chunk for the given period of time $[startTime, endTime]$ (in seconds) and frequency $freq$.
  - $freq$ is one of "minute", "hour", or "day" representing a frequency of every minute, hour, or day respectively.

```cpp
class TweetCounts {
    map<string, vector<int>> tweet;
public:
    TweetCounts() {
        
    }
    
    void recordTweet(string tweetName, int time) {
        tweet[tweetName].push_back(time);
    }
    
    vector<int> getTweetCountsPerFrequency(string freq, string tweetName, int startTime, int endTime) {
        auto& rec = tweet[tweetName];
        int period = freq == "minute" ? 60 : 
            freq == "hour" ? 3600 : 86400;

        vector<int> ans((endTime - startTime) / period + 1);

        for (auto t : rec)
            if (startTime <= t && t <= endTime)
                ++ ans[(t - startTime) / period];

        return ans;
    }
};
```
