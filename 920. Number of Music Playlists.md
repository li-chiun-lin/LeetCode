# Hard

Your music player contains $n$ different songs. You want to listen to $goal$ songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:

- Every song is played at least once.
- A song can only be played again only if $k$ other songs have been played.

Given $n$, $goal$, and $k$, return the number of possible playlists that you can create. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numMusicPlaylists(int n, int goal, int k) {
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<long long>> dp(goal + 1, vector<long long>(n + 1));
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= goal; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
            {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (n - (j - 1))) % m;

                if (j > k)
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + (dp[i - 1][j] * (j - k))) % m;
            }

        return dp[goal][n];
    }
};
```
