An integer $x$ is a good if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from $x$. Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. For example:

- 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves,
- 2 and 5 rotate to each other (in this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words, 2 or 5 gets mirrored),
- 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and
- the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Given an integer $n$, return the number of good integers in the range $[1, n]$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rotatedDigits(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
        {
            if (i < 10)
            {
                if (i == 0 || i == 1 || i == 8)
                    dp[i] = 1;
                else if (i == 2 || i == 5 || i == 6 || i == 9)
                    dp[i] = 2;
            }
            else
            {
                int a = dp[i / 10];
                int b = dp[i % 10];

                if (a == 1 && b == 1)
                    dp[i] = 1;
                else if (a && b)
                    dp[i] = 2;
            }
        }

        return count(begin(dp), end(dp), 2);
    }
};
```
