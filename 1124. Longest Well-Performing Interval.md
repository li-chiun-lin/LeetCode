# Medium

We are given $hours$, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.

A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than $8$.

A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestWPI(vector<int>& hours) {
        int n = hours.size();
        int ans = 0;
        int accu = 0;
        map<int, int> visited;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            accu += hours[i] > 8 ? 1 : -1;
            
            if (accu > 0)
                ans = i + 1;
            else
            {
                if (visited.count(accu) == 0)
                    visited[accu] = i;

                if (visited.count(accu - 1))
                    ans = max(ans, i - visited[accu - 1]);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
