There are $n$ oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:

- Eat one orange.
- If the number of remaining oranges $n$ is divisible by $2$ then you can eat $n / 2$ oranges.
- If the number of remaining oranges $n$ is divisible by $3$ then you can eat $2 \times (n / 3)$ oranges.

You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Given the integer $n$, return the minimum number of days to eat $n$ oranges.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDays(int n) {
        map<int, int> dp;

        function<int(int)> dfs = [&](int n) -> int
        {
            if (n <= 1)
                return n;

            if (dp.count(n))
                return dp[n];

            return dp[n] = 1 + min(n % 2 + dfs(n / 2), n % 3 + dfs(n / 3));
        };

        return dfs(n);
    }
};
```
