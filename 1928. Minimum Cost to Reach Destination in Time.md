There is a country of $n$ cities numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$ where all the cities are connected by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array $edges$ where $edges[i] = [x_i, y_i, time_i]$ denotes a road between cities $x_i$ and $y_i$ that takes $time_i$ minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a 0-indexed integer array $passingFees$ of length $n$ where $passingFees[j]$ is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city $j$.

In the beginning, you are at city $0$ and want to reach city $n - 1$ in $maxTime$ minutes or less. The cost of your journey is the summation of passing fees for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (including the source and destination cities).

Given $maxTime$, $edges$, and $passingFees$, return the minimum cost to complete your journey, or $-1$ if you cannot complete it within $maxTime$ minutes.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(int maxTime, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& passingFees) {
        int n = size(passingFees);
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back({e[1], e[2]});
            adj[e[1]].push_back({e[0], e[2]});
        }

        vector<int> cost(n, INT_MAX), time(n, INT_MAX);
        priority_queue<
            tuple<int, int, int>, 
            vector<tuple<int, int, int>>, 
            greater<>> pq;

        pq.push({cost[0] = passingFees[0], time[0] = 0, 0});

        while (size(pq))
        {
            auto [c, t, u] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            for (auto [v, tt] : adj[u])
            {
                if (t + tt > maxTime)
                    continue;

                if (cost[v] > c + passingFees[v])
                    pq.push({cost[v] = c + passingFees[v], time[v] = t + tt, v});
                else if (time[v] > t + tt)
                    pq.push({c + passingFees[v], time[v] = t + tt, v});
            }
        }

        return cost.back() == INT_MAX ? -1 : cost.back();
    }
};
