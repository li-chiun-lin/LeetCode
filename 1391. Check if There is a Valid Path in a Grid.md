# Medium

You are given an $m \times n$ $grid$. Each cell of $grid$ represents a street. The street of $grid[i][j]$ can be:

- $1$ which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
- $2$ which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
- $3$ which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
- $4$ which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
- $5$ which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
- $6$ which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell $(0, 0)$. A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell $(0, 0)$ and ends at the bottom-right cell $(m - 1, n - 1)$. The path should only follow the streets.

Notice that you are not allowed to change any street.

Return $true$ if there is a valid path in the grid or $false$ otherwise.
