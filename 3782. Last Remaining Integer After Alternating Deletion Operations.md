# Hard

You are given an integer $n$.

We write the integers from $1$ to $n$ in a sequence from left to right. Then, alternately apply the following two operations until only one integer remains, starting with operation 1:

- Operation 1: Starting from the left, delete every second number.
- Operation 2: Starting from the right, delete every second number.

Return the last remaining integer.

```cpp
