# Medium

You are given an integer array $capacity$.

A subarray $capacity[l..r]$ is considered stable if:

- Its length is at least $3$.
- The first and last elements are each equal to the sum of all elements strictly between them (i.e., $capacity[l] = capacity[r] = capacity[l + 1] + capacity[l + 2] + ... + capacity[r - 1]$).

Return an integer denoting the number of stable subarrays.
