# Medium

You are given a string $s$.

We define the mirror of a letter in the English alphabet as its corresponding letter when the alphabet is reversed.

Initially, all characters in the string $s$ are unmarked.

You start with a score of $0$, and you perform the following process on the string $s$:

- Iterate through the string from left to right.
- At each index $i$, find the closest unmarked index $j$ such that $j < i$ and $s[j]$ is the mirror of $s[i]$. Then, mark both indices $i$ and $j$, and add the value $i - j$ to the total score.
- If no such index $j$ exists for the index $i$, move on to the next index without making any changes.

Return the total score at the end of the process.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long calculateScore(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        long long ans = 0;

        // Track the last seen indices for each character ('a' to 'z')
        vector<stack<int>> lastSeen(26);
        // Track marked positions with a vector<bool> (to avoid modifying lastSeen directly)
        vector<bool> marked(n, false);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Calculate the mirror character for s[i]
            int mirrorIndex = 25 - (s[i] - 'a');

            // Find the first available position from the lastSeen stack
            while (!lastSeen[mirrorIndex].empty()) {
                int j = lastSeen[mirrorIndex].top();
                if (!marked[j]) {
                    marked[j] = true;
                    marked[i] = true;
                    ans += i - j;
                    lastSeen[mirrorIndex].pop();  // Remove the most recent index
                    break;
                }
                lastSeen[mirrorIndex].pop();  // If marked, discard
            }

            // Add the current index of s[i] to lastSeen for its character
            lastSeen[s[i] - 'a'].push(i);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
