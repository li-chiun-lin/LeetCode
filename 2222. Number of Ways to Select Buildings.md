You are given a 0-indexed binary string **s** which represents the types of buildings along a street where:

- **s[i] = '0'** denotes that the **i**-th building is an office and
- **s[i] = '1'** denotes that the **i**-th building is a restaurant.

As a city official, you would like to select **3** buildings for random inspection. However, to ensure variety, **no two consecutive** buildings out of the **selected** buildings can be of the same type.

- For example, given s = "0**0**1**1**0**1**", we cannot select the **1st**, **3rd**, and **5th** buildings as that would form **"011"** which is **not** allowed due to having two consecutive buildings of the same type.

Return the **number of valid ways** to select 3 buildings.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long numberOfWays(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> left1(n);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            left1[i] = left1[i - 1] + (s[i - 1] == '1');
        
        int total1 = left1.back() + (s.back() == '1');
        
        long long c = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i)
        {
            if (s[i] == '1')
            {
                //010
                int left0 = i - left1[i];
                int right0 = n - total1 - left0;
                
                c += left0 * right0;
            }
            else
            {
                //101
                int right1 = total1 - left1[i];
                c += left1[i] * right1;
            }
        }
        
        return c;
    }
