# Easy

You are given an array $nums$ consisting of positive integers.

Return the total frequencies of elements in $nums$ such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.

The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequencyElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> freq;
        int max_freq = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        
        for (int x : nums)
        {
            ++ freq[x];

            if (max_freq < freq[x])
                ans = max_freq = freq[x];
            else if (max_freq == freq[x])
                ans += max_freq;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
