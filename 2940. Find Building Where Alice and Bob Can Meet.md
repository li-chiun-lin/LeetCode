# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed array $heights$ of positive integers, where $heights[i]$ represents the height of the $i$-th building.

If a person is in building $i$, they can move to any other building $j$ if and only if $i < j$ and $heights[i] < heights[j]$.

You are also given another array $queries$ where $queries[i] = [a_i, b_i]$. On the $i$-th query, Alice is in building $a_i$ while Bob is in building $b_i$.

Return an array $ans$ where $ans[i]$ is the index of the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet on the $i$-th query. If Alice and Bob cannot move to a common building on query $i$, set $ans[i]$ to $-1$.
