# Medium

$n$ passengers board an airplane with exactly $n$ seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of the passengers will:

- Take their own seat if it is still available, and
- Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied

Return the probability that the $n$-th person gets his own seat.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        return n == 1 ? 1 : 0.5;
    }
};
```
