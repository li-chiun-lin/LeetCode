# Easy

Given an $n \times n$ binary matrix $image$, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.

To invert an image means that each $0$ is replaced by $1$, and each $1$ is replaced by $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> flipAndInvertImage(vector<vector<int>>& image) {
        int n = image.size();
        int tmp = 0;
        
        for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r)
        {
            int i = 0;
            int j = n - 1;
            
            for (; i < j; ++i, --j)
            {
                tmp = image[r][i];
                image[r][i] = 1 - image[r][j];
                image[r][j] = 1 - tmp;
            }
            
            if (i == j)
                image[r][i] = 1 - image[r][i];
        }
        
        return image;
    }
};
```
