# Easy

You are given an array of $n$ strings $strs$, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.

You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& strs) {
        int m = strs.size();
        int n = strs[0].size();
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i)
            {
                if (strs[i - 1][j] > strs[i][j])
                {
                    ++ cnt;
                    break;
                }
            }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
