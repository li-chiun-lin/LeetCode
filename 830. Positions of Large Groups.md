# Easy

In a string $s$ of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

A group is identified by an interval $[start, end]$, where $start$ and $end$ denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group.

A group is considered large if it has $3$ or more characters.

Return the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> largeGroupPositions(string s) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        int st = 0;
        int ed = 0;
        
        while (ed < s.size())
        {
            if (s[st] != s[ed])
            {
                if (ed - st >= 3)
                    ret.push_back({st, ed - 1});
                st = ed;
            }
            
            ++ ed;
        }
        
        if (ed - st >= 3)
            ret.push_back({st, ed - 1});
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
