# Hard

You have $n$ flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays $plantTime$ and $growTime$, of length $n$ each:

- $plantTime[i]$ is the number of full days it takes you to plant the $i$-th seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked $plantTime[i]$ days on planting it in total.
- $growTime[i]$ is the number of full days it takes the $i$-th seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.

From the beginning of day $0$, you can plant the seeds in any order.

Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int earliestFullBloom(vector<int>& plantTime, vector<int>& growTime) {
        int n = plantTime.size();
        vector<pair<int, int>> t(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            t[i] = {growTime[i], plantTime[i]};
        
        sort(begin(t), end(t), greater<>());
        
        int ret = 0;
        int c = 0;
        
        for (auto& p : t)
        {
            c += p.second;
            ret = max(ret, c + p.first);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
