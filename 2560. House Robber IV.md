# Medium

There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he refuses to steal from adjacent homes.

The capability of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.

You are given an integer array $nums$ representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the $i$-th house from the left has $nums[i]$ dollars.

You are also given an integer $k$, representing the minimum number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least $k$ houses.

Return the minimum capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least $k$ houses.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    int minCapability(vector<int>& nums, int k) 
    {
        int left = 1, right = 1e9, mid = 0;
        int size = nums.size();

        // Perform binary search on the possible minimum capability
        while (left < right) 
        {
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  // Calculate the middle value
            
            int count = 0; // Count of selected elements
            
            // Iterate through the array to count valid elements
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) 
            {
                if (nums[i] <= mid) 
                {
                    ++count;  // Select this element
                    ++i;      // Skip the next element to ensure non-adjacent selection
                }
            }

            // Adjust the binary search range based on the count
            if (count >= k)
                right = mid;  // Try for a lower capability
            else
                left = mid + 1;  // Increase the capability
        }

        return left; // The minimum possible capability
    }
};
```
