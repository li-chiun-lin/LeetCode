A string **originalText** is encoded using a slanted transposition cipher to a string **encodedText** with the help of a matrix having a fixed number of rows **rows**.

**originalText** is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner.

The blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow cells, and so on, until we reach the end of **originalText**. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are filled. All empty cells are filled with **' '**. The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will not be empty after filling in **originalText**.

**encodedText** is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion.

The characters in the blue cells are appended first to **encodedText**, then the red cells, and so on, and finally the yellow cells. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are accessed.

Given the encoded string **encodedText** and number of rows **rows**, return the original string **originalText**.

Note: **originalText** does not have any trailing spaces **' '**. The test cases are generated such that there is only one possible **originalText**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string decodeCiphertext(string encodedText, int rows) {
        int w = encodedText.size() / rows;
        
        vector<vector<char>> g(rows, vector<char>(w));
        int idx = 0;
        
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r)
            for (int c = 0; c < w; ++c)
                g[r][c] = encodedText[idx ++];
        
        string ret = "";
        int d = 0;
        
        while (true)
        {
            int i = 0;
            int j = d ++;
            
            if (j >= w)
                break;
            
            while (i < rows && j < w)
                ret += g[i ++][j ++];
        }
        
        while (ret.back() == ' ')
            ret.pop_back();
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
