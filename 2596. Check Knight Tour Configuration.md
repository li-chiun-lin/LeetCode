There is a knight on an $n \times n$ chessboard. In a valid configuration, the knight starts at the top-left cell of the board and visits every cell on the board exactly once.

You are given an $n \times n$ integer matrix $grid$ consisting of distinct integers from the range $[0, n * n - 1]$ where $grid[row] [col]$ indicates that the cell $(row, col)$ is the $grid[row] [col]^{th}$ cell that the knight visited. The moves are 0-indexed.

Return $true$ if $grid$ represents a valid configuration of the knight's movements or $false$ otherwise.

Note that a valid knight move consists of moving two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. The figure below illustrates all the possible eight moves of a knight from some cell.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkValidGrid(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int end = n * n;
        int c = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int di[] = {2,  2, -2, -2, 1, -1,  1, -1};
        int dj[] = {1, -1,  1, -1, 2,  2, -2, -2};
        
        while (c < end - 1)
        {
            if (grid[i][j] != c)
                return false;
            
            bool hit = false;
            
            for (int k = 0; k < 8; ++k)
            {
                int ii = i + di[k];
                int jj = j + dj[k];
                
                if (0 <= ii && ii < n && 0 <= jj && jj < n)
                {
                    if (grid[ii][jj] == c + 1)
                    {
                        hit = true;
                        i = ii;
                        j = jj;
                        ++ c;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            if (! hit)
                return false;
        }
        
        return grid[i][j] = c;
    }
};
```
