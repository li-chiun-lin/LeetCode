# Easy

You are given a positive number $n$.

Return the smallest number $x$ greater than or equal to $n$, such that the binary representation of $x$ contains only set bits.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestNumber(int n) {
        int ans = 1;

        while (ans < n)
            ans = (ans << 1) | 1;

        return ans;
    }
};
```
