You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes **a​​​​​​, b,​​​​​​ and c**​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add **1** point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

Given three integers **a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c**​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        int s = 0;
        
        pq.push(a);
        pq.push(b);
        pq.push(c);
        
        while (true)
        {
            int t1 = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int t2 = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            
            if (t2 == 0)
                break;
            
            // this is critial to avoid loop
            int d = min(t2 - pq.top() + 1, t2);
            
            pq.push(t1 - d);
            pq.push(t2 - d);
            
            s += d;
        }
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
