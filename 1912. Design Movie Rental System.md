# Hard

You have a movie renting company consisting of $n$ shops. You want to implement a renting system that supports searching for, booking, and returning movies. The system should also support generating a report of the currently rented movies.

Each movie is given as a 2D integer array $entries$ where $entries[i] = [shop_i, movie_i, price_i]$ indicates that there is a copy of movie $movie_i$ at shop $shop_i$ with a rental price of $price_i$. Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie $movie_i$.

The system should support the following functions:

- Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller $shop_i$ should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.
- Rent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop.
- Drop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop.
- Report: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list $res$ where $res[j] = [shop_j, movie_j]$ describes that the $j$-th cheapest rented movie $movie_j$ was rented from the shop $shop_j$. The movies in $res$ should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller $shop_j$ should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the smaller $movie_j$ should appear first. If there are fewer than 5 rented movies, then all of them should be returned. If no movies are currently being rented, then an empty list should be returned.

Implement the __MovieRentingSystem__ class:

- __MovieRentingSystem(int n, int[][] entries)__ Initializes the __MovieRentingSystem__ object with $n$ shops and the movies in $entries$.
- __List\<Integer\> search(int movie)__ Returns a list of shops that have an unrented copy of the given $movie$ as described above.
- __void rent(int shop, int movie)__ Rents the given $movie$ from the given $shop$.
- __void drop(int shop, int movie)__ Drops off a previously rented $movie$ at the given $shop$.
- __List\<List\<Integer\>\> report()__ Returns a list of cheapest rented movies as described above.

    map<int, map<int, int>> price;
    map<int, set<pair<int, int>>> available;
    set<tuple<int, int, int>> rented;

public:
    MovieRentingSystem(int n, vector<vector<int>>& entries) {
        for (auto& e : entries)
        {
            int s = e[0];
            int m = e[1];
            int p = e[2];

            available[m].insert({p, s});
            price[s][m] = p;
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> search(int movie) {
        vector<int> ans;

        for (auto& [p, s] : available[movie])
        {
            ans.push_back(s);

            if (size(ans) == 5)
                break;
        }

        return ans;
    }
    
    void rent(int shop, int movie) {
        int p = price[shop][movie];
        available[movie].erase(available[movie].find({p, shop}));
        rented.insert({p, shop, movie});
    }
    
    void drop(int shop, int movie) {
        int p = price[shop][movie];
        rented.erase(rented.find({p, shop, movie}));
        available[movie].insert({p, shop});
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> report() {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;

        for (auto& [p, s, m] : rented)
        {
            ans.push_back({s, m});

            if (size(ans) == 5)
                break;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
