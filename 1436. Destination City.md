# Easy

You are given the array $paths$, where $paths[i] = [cityA_i, cityB_i]$ means there exists a direct path going from $cityA_i$ to $cityB_i$. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string destCity(vector<vector<string>>& paths) {
        map<string, bool> to;
        map<string, bool> from;
        
        for (auto &p : paths)
        {
            from[p[0]] = true;
            to[p[1]] = true;
        }
        
        for (auto &c : to)
        {
            if (! from[c.first])
                return c.first;
        }
        
        return "";
    }
};
```
