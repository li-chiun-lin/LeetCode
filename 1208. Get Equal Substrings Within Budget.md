# Medium

You are given two strings $s$ and $t$ of the same length and an integer $maxCost$.

You want to change $s$ to $t$. Changing the $i$-th character of $s$ to $i$-th character of $t$ costs $|s[i] - t[i]|$.

Return the maximum length of a substring of $s$ that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of $t$ with a cost less than or equal to $maxCost$. If there is no substring from $s$ that can be changed to its corresponding substring from $t$, return $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> cost(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            cost[i] = abs(s[i] - t[i]);
        
        int ret = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int acc = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            acc += cost[i];
            
            while (acc > maxCost)
                acc -= cost[j ++];
            
            ret = max(ret, i - j + 1);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
