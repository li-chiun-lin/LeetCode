# Medium

A **width** x **height** grid is on an XY-plane with the bottom-left cell at (**0, 0**) and the top-right cell at (**width - 1, height - 1**). The grid is aligned with the four cardinal directions (**"North", "East", "South"**, and **"West"**). A robot is initially at cell (**0, 0**) facing direction **"East"**.

The robot can be instructed to move for a specific number of steps. For each step, it does the following.

1. Attempts to move **forward one** cell in the direction it is facing.
1. If the cell the robot is moving to is out of bounds, the robot instead turns 90 degrees **counterclockwise** and retries the step.

After the robot finishes moving the number of steps required, it stops and awaits the next instruction.

Implement the **Robot** class:

- **Robot(int width, int height)** Initializes the **width** x **height** grid with the robot at (**0, 0**) facing **"East"**.
- **void step(int num)** Instructs the robot to move forward num steps.
- **int[] getPos()** Returns the current cell the robot is at, as an array of length 2, **[x, y]**.
- **String getDir()** Returns the current direction of the robot, **"North", "East", "South"**, or **"West"**.

## My Solution

We might agree this is not a dam complicated problem, but many of us might get stuck in the middle of no where.
The devil is in the details.
Here I share some crucial hints after I finally conquer it after few hours.

1. modulo **num** with **(w + h - 2) * 2**, not **(w + h) * 2**.
2. when the end position is at the corner, don't turn it just yet.

```cpp
class Robot {
    string str[4] = {"East", "North", "West", "South"};
    int d;
    int w;
    int h;
    int x;
    int y;
    int loop;
    
public:
    Robot(int width, int height) {
        w = width;
        h = height;
        d = 0;
        x = 0;
        y = 0;
        loop = (w + h - 2) * 2;
    }
    
    void step(int num) {
        // this is crucial.
        num %= loop;
        
        // this is also crucial.
        if (num == 0)
            num = loop;
        
        if (d == 0)
        {
            if (x + num < w)
                x += num;
            else
            {
                num -= w - x - 1;
                x = w - 1;
                d = 1;
                step(num);
            }
        }
        else if (d == 1)
        {
            if (y + num < h)
                y += num;
            else
            {
                num -= h - y - 1;
                y = h - 1;
                d = 2;
                step(num);
            }
        }
        else if (d == 2)
        {
            if (x >= num)
                x -= num;
            else
            {
                num -= x;
                x = 0;
                d = 3;
                step(num);
            }
        }
        else if (d == 3)
        {
            if (y >= num)
                y -= num;
            else
            {
                num -= y;
                y = 0;
                d = 0;
                step(num);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> getPos() {
        return {x, y};
    }
    
    string getDir() {
        return str[d];
    }
};
```
