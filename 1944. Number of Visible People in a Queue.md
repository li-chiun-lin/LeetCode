# Hard

There are $n$ people standing in a queue, and they numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$ in left to right order. You are given an array $heights$ of distinct integers where $heights[i]$ represents the height of the $i$-th person.

A person can see another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is shorter than both of them. More formally, the $i$-th person can see the $j$-th person if $i < j$ and $\min(heights[i], heights[j]) > \max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])$.

Return an array $answer$ of length $n$ where $answer[i]$ is the number of people the $i$-th person can see to their right in the queue.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> canSeePersonsCount(vector<int>& heights) {
        int n = size(heights);
        vector<int> ans(n);
        stack<int> sta;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            while (size(sta) && heights[sta.top()] <= heights[i])
            {
                ++ ans[sta.top()];
                sta.pop();
            }

            if (size(sta))
                ++ ans[sta.top()];

            sta.push(i);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
