# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed string $s$ typed by a user. Changing a key is defined as using a key different from the last used key.

Return the number of times the user had to change the key.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countKeyChanges(string s) {
        char pre = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (char c : s)
        {
            c = tolower(c);
            
            if (pre != c)
            {
                pre = c;
                ++ cnt;
            }
        }
        
        return cnt - 1;
    }
};
```
