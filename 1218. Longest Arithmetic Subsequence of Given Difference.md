# Medium

Given an integer array $arr$ and an integer $difference$, return the length of the longest subsequence in $arr$ which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals $difference$.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from $arr$ by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int difference) {
        unordered_map<int, int> dp;
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int x : arr)
            dp[x] = 1 + dp[x - difference];
        
        for (auto& p : dp)
            ret = max(ret, p.second);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
