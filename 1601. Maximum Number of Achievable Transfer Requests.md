# Hard

We have $n$ buildings numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array $requests$ where $requests[i] = [from_i, to_i]$ represents an employee's request to transfer from building $from_i$ to building $to_i$.

All buildings are full, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the net change in employee transfers is zero. This means the number of employees leaving is equal to the number of employees moving in.

Return the maximum number of achievable requests.

```cpp
class Solution {
    void dfs(int i, vector<vector<int>>& r, vector<int>& trans, int cnt, int& ret)
    {
        if (i == r.size())
        {
            for (auto t : trans)
                if (t)
                    return;

            ret = max(ret, cnt);
        }
        else
        {
            // dont
            dfs(i + 1, r, trans, cnt, ret);

            // take
            -- trans[r[i][0]];
            ++ trans[r[i][1]];

            dfs(i + 1, r, trans, cnt + 1, ret);

            ++ trans[r[i][0]];
            -- trans[r[i][1]];
        }
    }

public:
    int maximumRequests(int n, vector<vector<int>>& requests) {
        int ret = 0;
        vector<int> trans(n);

        dfs(0, requests, trans, 0, ret);

        return ret;
    }
};
```
