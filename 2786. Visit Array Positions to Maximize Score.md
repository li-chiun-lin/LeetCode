You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ and a positive integer $x$.

You are initially at position $0$ in the array and you can visit other positions according to the following rules:

- If you are currently in position $i$, then you can move to any position $j$ such that $i < j$.
- For each position $i$ that you visit, you get a score of $nums[i]$.
- If you move from a position $i$ to a position $j$ and the parities of $nums[i]$ and $nums[j]$ differ, then you lose a score of $x$.

Return the maximum total score you can get.

Note that initially you have $nums[0]$ points.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxScore(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.size();
        long long e = nums[0] - (nums[0] % 2 ? x : 0);
        long long o = nums[0] - (nums[0] % 2 ? 0 : x);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (nums[i] % 2)
                o = nums[i] + max(o, e - x);
            else
                e = nums[i] + max(e, o - x);
        }

        return max(e, o);
    }
};
```
