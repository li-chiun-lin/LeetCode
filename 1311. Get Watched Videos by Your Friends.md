There are $n$ people, each person has a unique id between $0$ and $n-1$. Given the arrays $watchedVideos$ and $friends$, where $watchedVideos[i]$ and $friends[i]$ contain the list of watched videos and the list of friends respectively for the person with $id = i$.

Level $1$ of videos are all watched videos by your friends, level $2$ of videos are all watched videos by the friends of your friends and so on. In general, the level $k$ of videos are all watched videos by people with the shortest path exactly equal to $k$ with you. Given your $id$ and the $level$ of videos, return the list of videos ordered by their frequencies (increasing). For videos with the same frequency order them alphabetically from least to greatest.
