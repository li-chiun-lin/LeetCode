# Easy

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the $0$'s to $1$'s and all the $1$'s to $0$'s in its binary representation.

Given an integer $n$, return its complement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
        int mask = 1;
        
        if (n == 0)
            return 1;
        
        while (mask <= n)
            mask <<= 1;
        
        return n ^ (mask - 1);
    }
};
```
