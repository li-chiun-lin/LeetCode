You are given two strings $s1$ and $s2$ of equal length consisting of letters **"x"** and **"y"** only. Your task is to make these two strings equal to each other. You can swap any two characters that belong to different strings, which means: swap $s1[i]$ and $s2[j]$.

Return the minimum number of swaps required to make $s1$ and $s2$ equal, or return $-1$ if it is impossible to do so.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSwap(string s1, string s2) {
        int n = s1.size();
        int x = 0;
        int xy = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (s1[i] != s2[i])
            {
                if (s1[i] == 'x')
                    ++ x;
                
                ++ xy;
            }
        
        if (xy % 2)
            return -1;
        
        return xy / 2 + x % 2;
    }
};
```
