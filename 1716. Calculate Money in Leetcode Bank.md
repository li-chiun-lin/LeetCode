# Easy

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $\$1$ on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $\$1$ more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $\$1$ more than the previous Monday.

Given $n$, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the $n$-th day.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int week_sum = 28;
        
        int w = n / 7;
        int d = n % 7;
        
        int sum = w * week_sum;
        sum += 7 * w * (w - 1) / 2;
        sum += d * (d + 1) / 2;
        sum += w * d;
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
