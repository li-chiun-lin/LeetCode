# Easy

You are given integers $n$, $m$, and $k$.

There are two logs of lengths $n$ and $m$ units, which need to be transported in three trucks where each truck can carry one log with length at most $k$ units.

You may cut the logs into smaller pieces, where the cost of cutting a log of length $x$ into logs of length $len1$ and $len2$ is $cost = len1 \times len2$ such that $len1 + len2 = x$.

Return the minimum total cost to distribute the logs onto the trucks. If the logs don't need to be cut, the total cost is $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Calculate minimum total cost to cut logs of length n and m
    // so that each resulting piece is <= k and fits in a truck.
    long long minCuttingCost(int n, int m, int k) {
        long long cost = 0;

        // Only cut if the log is longer than k
        if (n > k) {
            cost += static_cast<long long>(k) * (n - k);
        }

        if (m > k) {
            cost += static_cast<long long>(k) * (m - k);
        }

        return cost;
    }
};
```
