# Medium

You are given $n$ points in the plane that are all distinct, where $points[i] = [x_i, y_i]$. A boomerang is a tuple of points $(i, j, k)$ such that the distance between $i$ and $j$ equals the distance between $i$ and $k$ (the order of the tuple matters).

Return the number of boomerangs.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfBoomerangs(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size();
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            map<int, int> dist;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            {
                int d = pow(points[i][0] - points[j][0], 2) + 
                        pow(points[i][1] - points[j][1], 2);
                
                ++ dist[d];
            }
            
            for (auto &ds : dist)
                cnt += ds.second * (ds.second - 1);
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
```
