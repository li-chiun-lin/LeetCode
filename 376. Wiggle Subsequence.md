A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array $nums$, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of $nums$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        if (n < 2)
            return n;
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(n));
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j)
            {
                if (nums[j] < nums[i])
                    dp[0][i] = max(dp[0][i], dp[1][j] + 1);
                else if (nums[i] < nums[j])
                    dp[1][i] = max(dp[1][i], dp[0][j] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return max(dp[0][n - 1], dp[1][n - 1]) + 1;
    }
};
```
