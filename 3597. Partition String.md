Given a string $s$, partition it into unique segments according to the following procedure:

- Start building a segment beginning at index 0.
- Continue extending the current segment character by character until the current segment has not been seen before.
- Once the segment is unique, add it to your list of segments, mark it as seen, and begin a new segment from the next index.
- Repeat until you reach the end of $s$.

Return an array of strings $segments$, where $segments[i]$ is the $i$-th segment created.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> partitionString(string s) {
        vector<string> result;
        unordered_set<char> seen; // To track characters in current substring
        string current = "";

        for (char c : s) {
            if (seen.count(c)) {
                // Current char already in the substring: partition here
                result.push_back(current);
                seen.clear();
                current = "";
            }
            current += c;
            seen.insert(c);
        }

        // Add the last substring
        if (!current.empty())
            result.push_back(current);

        return result;
    }
};
```
