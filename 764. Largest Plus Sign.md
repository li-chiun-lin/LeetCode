# Medium

You are given an integer $n$. You have an $n \times n$ binary grid $grid$ with all values initially $1$'s except for some indices given in the array $mines$. The $i$-th element of the array mines is defined as $mines[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ where $grid[x_i] [y_i] == 0$.

Return the order of the largest axis-aligned plus sign of $1$'s contained in $grid$. If there is none, return $0$.

An axis-aligned plus sign of $1$'s of order $k$ has some center $grid[r] [c] == 1$ along with four arms of length $k - 1$ going up, down, left, and right, and made of $1$'s. Note that there could be $0$'s or $1$'s beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for $1$'s.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int orderOfLargestPlusSign(int n, vector<vector<int>>& mines) {
        vector<vector<int>> grid(n, vector<int>(n, 1));
        vector<vector<int>> left(n, vector<int>(n));
        vector<vector<int>> right(n, vector<int>(n));
        vector<vector<int>> up(n, vector<int>(n));
        vector<vector<int>> down(n, vector<int>(n));
        
        for (auto& x : mines)
            grid[x[0]][x[1]] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            left[i][0] = grid[i][0];
            right[i][n - 1] = grid[i][n - 1];
            
            down[0][i] = grid[0][i];
            up[n - 1][i] = grid[n - 1][i];
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j)

                    right[i][j] = right[i][j + 1] + 1;
