# Easy

You are given an $m \times n$ integer grid $accounts$ where $accounts[i][j]$ is the amount of money the $i$-​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the $j​​​​​​​​​​​$-th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumWealth(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) {
        int m = 0;
        
        for (int c = 0; c < accounts.size(); ++c)
            m = max(m, accumulate(begin(accounts[c]), end(accounts[c]), 0));
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
