You are given a 0-indexed $m \times n$ integer matrix $grid$ consisting of distinct integers from $0$ to $m \times n - 1$. You can move in this matrix from a cell to any other cell in the next row. That is, if you are in cell ($x, y$) such that $x < m - 1$, you can move to any of the cells $(x + 1, 0), (x + 1, 1), ..., (x + 1, n - 1)$. Note that it is not possible to move from cells in the last row.

Each possible move has a cost given by a 0-indexed 2D array $moveCost$ of size $(m \times n) \times n$, where $moveCost[i][j]$ is the cost of moving from a cell with value $i$ to a cell in column $j$ of the next row. The cost of moving from cells in the last row of $grid$ can be ignored.

The cost of a path in $grid$ is the sum of all values of cells visited plus the sum of costs of all the moves made. Return the minimum cost of a path that starts from any cell in the first row and ends at any cell in the last row.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPathCost(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& moveCost) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(n));
        int cur = 1;
        int prv = 1 - cur;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            dp[0][j] = grid[0][j];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            {
                dp[cur][j] = INT_MAX;
                
                // the minimum cost from each column k from the previous row i - 1 plus the moving cost from k to the current j.
                for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k)
                    dp[cur][j] = min(dp[cur][j], dp[prv][k] + moveCost[grid[i - 1][k]][j]);
                
                // the value of cell j
                dp[cur][j] += grid[i][j];
            }
            
            prv = cur;
            cur = 1 - prv;
        }
        
        return *min_element(begin(dp[prv]), end(dp[prv]));
    }
};
