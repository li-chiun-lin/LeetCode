# Medium

You are given an array $maximumHeight$, where $maximumHeight[i]$ denotes the maximum height the $i$-th tower can be assigned.

Your task is to assign a height to each tower so that:

1. The height of the $i$-th tower is a positive integer and does not exceed $maximumHeight[i]$.
1. No two towers have the same height.

Return the maximum possible total sum of the tower heights. If it's not possible to assign heights, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumTotalSum(vector<int>& maximumHeight) {
        sort(begin(maximumHeight), end(maximumHeight), greater<>());

        int h = INT_MAX;
        long long ans = 0;

        for (auto x : maximumHeight)
        {
            h = min(h - 1, x);

            if (h <= 0)
                return -1;

            ans += h;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
