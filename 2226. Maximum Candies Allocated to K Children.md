# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $candies$. Each element in the array denotes a pile of candies of size $candies[i]$. You can divide each pile into any number of sub piles, but you cannot merge two piles together.

You are also given an integer $k$. You should allocate piles of candies to $k$ children such that each child gets the same number of candies. Each child can take at most one pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.

Return the maximum number of candies each child can get.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    int maximumCandies(vector<int>& candies, long long numChildren) 
    {
        int left = 0, right = 1e7;

        // Perform binary search to find the maximum candy portion each child can receive
        while (left < right) 
        {
            int mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
            long long totalCandies = 0;

            // Calculate the total number of children that can receive at least 'mid' candies
            for (int candy : candies)
                totalCandies += candy / mid;

            // If the total number of children that can be served is less than required, reduce portion size
            if (numChildren > totalCandies)
                right = mid - 1;
            else
                left = mid; // Otherwise, increase portion size
        }

        return left;
    }
};
