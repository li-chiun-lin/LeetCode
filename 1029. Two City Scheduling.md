# Medium

A company is planning to interview $2n$ people. Given the array $costs$ where $costs[i] = [aCost_i, bCost_i]$, the cost of flying the $i$-th person to city $a$ is $aCost_i$, and the cost of flying the $i$-th person to city $b$ is $bCost_i$.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly $n$ people arrive in each city.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int twoCitySchedCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        int n = costs.size();
        int n2 = n / 2;
        vector<int> diff(n);
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            sum += costs[i][0];
            diff[i] = costs[i][1] - costs[i][0];
        }
        
        sort(diff.begin(), diff.end());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n2; ++i)
            sum += diff[i];
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
