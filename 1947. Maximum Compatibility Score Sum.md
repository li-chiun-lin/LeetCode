There is a survey that consists of **n** questions where each question's answer is either **0** (no) or **1** (yes).

The survey was given to **m** students numbered from **0 to m - 1** and **m** mentors numbered from **0 to m - 1**. \
The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array **students** where **students[i]** is an integer array that contains the answers of the **i**-th student (0-indexed). \
The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array **mentors** where **mentors[j]** is an integer array that contains the answers of the **j**-th mentor (0-indexed).

Each student will be assigned to **one** mentor, and each mentor will have **one** student assigned to them. The **compatibility score** of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the **same** for both the student and the mentor.

- For example, if the student's answers were [1, **0**, **1**] and the mentor's answers were [0, **0**, **1**], then their compatibility score is **2** because only the second and the third answers are the same.

You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to **maximize** the sum of the compatibility scores.

Given students and mentors, return the **maximum** compatibility score sum that can be achieved.
