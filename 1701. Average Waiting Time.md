# Medium

There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array $customers$, where $customers[i] = [arrival_i, time_i]$:

- $arrival_i$ is the arrival time of the $i$-th customer. The arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- $time_i$ is the time needed to prepare the order of the $i$-th customer.

When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes preparing his order. The chef does not prepare food for more than one customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they were given in the input.

Return the average waiting time of all customers.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double averageWaitingTime(vector<vector<int>>& customers) {
        double waiting_time = 0;
        int processing_until = 0;
        
        for (auto &c : customers)
        {
            // finished before next customer arrive, the next customer doesn't have to wait for extra time.
            if (processing_until <= c[0])
            {
                // serve next customer till finish
                processing_until = c[0] + c[1];
            }
            // haven't finish the current customer, the next customer has to wait some extra time.
            else
            {
                // the extra waiting time
                waiting_time += processing_until - c[0];
                processing_until += c[1];
            }
            
            // the basic waiting time for each customer
            waiting_time += c[1];
        }
        
        return waiting_time / customers.size();
    }
};
```
