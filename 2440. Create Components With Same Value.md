# Hard

There is an undirected tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ of length $n$ where $nums[i]$ represents the value of the $i$-th node. You are also given a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$ where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree.

You are allowed to delete some edges, splitting the tree into multiple connected components. Let the value of a component be the sum of all $nums[i]$ for which node $i$ is in the component.

Return the maximum number of edges you can delete, such that every connected component in the tree has the same value.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& adj, int u, vector<int>& acc, int val)
    {
        acc[u] = nums[u];
        
        for (int v : adj[u])
        {
            if (acc[v])
                continue;
            
            acc[u] += dfs(nums, adj, v, acc, val);
            
            if (acc[u] > val)
                return 1e9 + 7;
        }
        
        return acc[u] == val ? 0 : acc[u];
    }
    
public:
    int componentValue(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        
        int sum = accumulate(begin(nums), end(nums), 0);
        
        for (int v = n; v > 1; --v)
        {
            if (sum % v)
                continue;
            
            vector<int> acc(n);
            
            if (dfs(nums, adj, 0, acc, sum / v) == 0)
                return v - 1;
        }
        
        return 0;
    }
