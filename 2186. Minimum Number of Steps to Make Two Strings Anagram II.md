You are given two strings **s** and **t**. In one step, you can append any character to either **s** or **t**.

Return the minimum number of steps to make **s** and **t** anagrams of each other.

An anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> hist(26);
        
        for (char c : s)
            ++ hist[c - 'a'];
        
        for (char c : t)
            -- hist[c - 'a'];
        
        int c = 0;
        
        for (int h : hist)
            c += abs(h);
        
        return c;
    }
};
```
