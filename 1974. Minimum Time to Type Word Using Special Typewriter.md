# Easy

There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters **'a' to 'z'** arranged in a circle with a pointer. A character can only be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is initially pointing to the character **'a'**.

Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:

- Move the pointer one character counterclockwise or clockwise.
- Type the character the pointer is currently on.

Given a string **word**, return the minimum number of seconds to type out the characters in **word**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToType(string word) {
        int n = word.size();
        int d = word[0] - 'a';
        int cnt = n + min(d, 26 - d);
 
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            d = (word[i] - word[i - 1] + 26) % 26;
            cnt += min(d, 26 - d);
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
