# Medium

You are given an integer array $cookies$, where $cookies[i]$ denotes the number of cookies in the $i$-th bag. You are also given an integer $k$ that denotes the number of children to distribute all the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.

The unfairness of a distribution is defined as the maximum total cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.

Return the minimum unfairness of all distributions.

```cpp
class Solution {
    void dfs(int i, vector<int>& cookies, vector<int> &child, int &ret)
    {
        if (i == cookies.size())
        {
            int ma = *max_element(begin(child), end(child));
            ret = min(ret, ma);
        }
        else
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < child.size(); ++j)
            {
                // if we try to give the i-th bag to the j-th child
                child[j] += cookies[i];
                
                dfs(i + 1, cookies, child, ret);
                
                // backtracking
                child[j] -= cookies[i];
            }
        }
    }
    
public:
    int distributeCookies(vector<int>& cookies, int k) {
        int n = cookies.size();
        //sort(begin(cookies), end(cookies));
        vector<int> child(k);
        int ret = INT_MAX;
        
        dfs(0, cookies, child, ret);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
