# Hard

You have $n$ robots. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, $chargeTimes$ and $runningCosts$, both of length $n$. The $i$-th robot costs $chargeTimes[i]$ units to charge and costs $runningCosts[i]$ units to run. You are also given an integer $budget$.

The total cost of running $k$ chosen robots is equal to $\max(chargeTimes) + k \times \sum(runningCosts)$, where $\max(chargeTimes)$ is the largest charge cost among the $k$ robots and $\sum(runningCosts)$ is the sum of running costs among the $k$ robots.

Return the maximum number of consecutive robots you can run such that the total cost does not exceed $budget$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumRobots(vector<int>& chargeTimes, vector<int>& runningCosts, long long budget) {
        int n = size(chargeTimes);
        long long left = 0;
        long long sum = 0;
        multiset<int> ms;

        for (long long right = 0; right < n; ++right)
        {
            sum += runningCosts[right];
            ms.insert(chargeTimes[right]);

            if (*rbegin(ms) + sum * (right - left + 1) > budget)
            {
                sum -= runningCosts[left];
                ms.erase(ms.find(chargeTimes[left ++]));
            }
        }

        return n - left;
    }
};
