# Easy

You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every second, you can either fill up $2$ cups with different types of water, or $1$ cup of any type of water.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $amount$ of length $3$ where $amount[0]$, $amount[1]$, and $amount[2]$ denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to fill respectively. Return the minimum number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int fillCups(vector<int>& amount) {
        priority_queue<int> pq(begin(amount), end(amount));
        int t = 0;
        int a = 1, b = 1, c;
        
        while (true)
        {
            a = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            b = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            
            if (a == 0 || b == 0)
                break;
        
            t += 1;
            pq.push(-- a);
            pq.push(-- b);
        }
        
        return t + a + b + pq.top();
    }
};
```
