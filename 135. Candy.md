# Hard

There are $n$ children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array $ratings$.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size();
        vector<int> candy(n, 1);  // Every child must get at least 1 candy
        
        // From left to right: If rating increases, give more candy than the left child
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1])
                candy[i] = candy[i - 1] + 1;
        
        // From right to left: If rating increases, ensure more candy than the right child
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1])
                candy[i] = max(candy[i], candy[i + 1] + 1);
        
        // Total candies is the sum of the final distribution
        return accumulate(candy.begin(), candy.end(), 0);
    }
};
```
