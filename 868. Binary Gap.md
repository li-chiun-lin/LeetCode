# Easy

Given a positive integer $n$, find and return the longest distance between any two adjacent $1$'s in the binary representation of $n$. If there are no two adjacent $1$'s, return $0$.

Two $1$'s are adjacent if there are only $0$'s separating them (possibly no $0$'s). The distance between two $1$'s is the absolute difference between their bit positions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int binaryGap(int n) {
        int m = 0;
        int pre = n;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (n)
        {
            if (n & 1)
            {
                m = max(m, i - pre);
                pre = i;
            }
            
            ++ i;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
