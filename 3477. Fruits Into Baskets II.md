# Easy

You are given two arrays of integers, $fruits$ and $baskets$, each of length $n$, where $fruits[i]$ represents the quantity of the $i$-th type of fruit, and $baskets[j]$ represents the capacity of the $j$-th basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

- Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
- Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
- If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.

Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfUnplacedFruits(vector<int>& fruits, vector<int>& baskets) 
    {
        int n = fruits.size();
        vector<bool> basket_used(n, false); // Tracks which baskets are already used
        int placed_count = 0; // Count of successfully placed fruits

        // Try to place each fruit in a suitable basket
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) 
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) 
            {
                // If the basket can hold the fruit and is not used yet
                if (baskets[j] >= fruits[i] && !basket_used[j]) 
                {
                    basket_used[j] = true; // Mark basket as used
                    ++placed_count; // Increase placed fruit count
                    break; // Move to the next fruit
                }
            }
        }

        return n - placed_count; // Return number of unplaced fruits
    }
};
```
