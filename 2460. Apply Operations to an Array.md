# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed array $nums$ of size $n$ consisting of non-negative integers.

You need to apply $n - 1$ operations to this array where, in the $i$-th operation (0-indexed), you will apply the following on the $i$-th element of nums:

- If $nums[i] == nums[i + 1]$, then multiply $nums[i]$ by $2$$ and set nums[i + 1]$ to $0$. Otherwise, you skip this operation.

After performing all the operations, shift all the $0$'s to the end of the array.

Return the resulting array.

Note that the operations are applied sequentially, not all at once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> applyOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // First pass: Merge adjacent equal numbers and set the second one to zero
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) continue;
            
            if (nums[i - 1] == nums[i]) {
                nums[i - 1] <<= 1; // Double the first number
                nums[i] = 0;       // Set the second number to zero
            }
        }
        
        // Second pass: Move all nonzero elements to the front, maintaining order
        int j = 0; // Pointer for the position to place the next nonzero element
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                nums[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Fill the remaining positions with zeros
        while (j < n) {
            nums[j++] = 0;
        }
        
        return nums;
    }
};
```
