# Hard

There is an undirected tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array $values$ of length $n$, where $values[i]$ is the value associated with the $i$-th node, and an integer $k$.

A valid split of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges, possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have values that are divisible by $k$, where the value of a connected component is the sum of the values of its nodes.

Return the maximum number of components in any valid split.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(int u, int p, vector<vector<int>>& adj, int& cnt, vector<int>& values, int k)
    {
        int s = values[u];
        
        for (int v : adj[u])
            if (v != p)
                s += dfs(v, u, adj, cnt, values, k);
        
        if ((s %= k) == 0)
            ++ cnt;
        
        return s;
    }
    
public:
    int maxKDivisibleComponents(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& values, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        
        int cnt = 0;
        
        dfs(0, -1, adj, cnt, values, k);
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
