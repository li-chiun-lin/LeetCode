# Hard

There is an undirected tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array $values$ of length $n$, where $values[i]$ is the value associated with the $i$-th node, and an integer $k$.

A valid split of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges, possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have values that are divisible by $k$, where the value of a connected component is the sum of the values of its nodes.

Return the maximum number of components in any valid split.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Helper function to perform DFS
    int dfs(int node, int parent, const vector<vector<int>>& adj, int& count, const vector<int>& values, int k) {
        int sum = values[node];

        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (neighbor != parent) {
                sum += dfs(neighbor, node, adj, count, values, k);
            }
        }

        if (sum % k == 0) {
            ++count;  // Increment count if the current subtree sum is divisible by k
        }

        return sum % k;
    }

public:
    int maxKDivisibleComponents(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& values, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);

        // Build the adjacency list
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

        int count = 0;

        // Start DFS from the root node (assumed to be node 0)
        dfs(0, -1, adj, count, values, k);

        return count;
    }
};
