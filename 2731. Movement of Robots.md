# Medium

Some robots are standing on an infinite number line with their initial coordinates given by a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ and will start moving once given the command to move. The robots will move a unit distance each second.

You are given a string $s$ denoting the direction in which robots will move on command. 'L' means the robot will move towards the left side or negative side of the number line, whereas 'R' means the robot will move towards the right side or positive side of the number line.

If two robots collide, they will start moving in opposite directions.

Return the sum of distances between all the pairs of robots $d$ seconds after the command. Since the sum can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumDistance(vector<int>& nums, string s, int d) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (s[i] == 'R')
                nums[i] += d;
            else
                nums[i] -= d;
        }
        
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));
                
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        long long sum = 0;
        long long prefix = 0;
        
        for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            sum += i * nums[i] - prefix;
            sum %= mod;
            prefix += nums[i];
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
