# Easy

You are given a string $s$ consisting of digits. Perform the following operation repeatedly until the string has exactly two digits:

- For each pair of consecutive digits in $s$, starting from the first digit, calculate a new digit as the sum of the two digits modulo 10.
- Replace $s$ with the sequence of newly calculated digits, maintaining the order in which they are computed.

Return $true$ if the final two digits in $s$ are the same; otherwise, return $false$.

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasSameDigits(string s) {
        // Reduce the string until only two digits remain
        while (s.size() > 2) {
            int length = s.size();

            // Compute adjacent sums (mod 10) and store results in place
            for (int i = 0; i < length - 1; ++i) {
                int digitSum = ((s[i] - '0') + (s[i + 1] - '0')) % 10;
                s[i] = digitSum + '0';  // Update current position with new digit
            }

            // Remove the last character since it has been processed
            s.pop_back();
        }

        // Check if the final two digits are the same
        return s[0] == s[1];
    }
};
```
