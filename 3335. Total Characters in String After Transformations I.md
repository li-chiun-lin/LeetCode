You are given a string $s$ and an integer $t$, representing the number of transformations to perform. In one transformation, every character in $s$ is replaced according to the following rules:

- If the character is 'z', replace it with the string "ab".
- Otherwise, replace it with the next character in the alphabet.

Return the length of the resulting string after exactly $t$ transformations.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthAfterTransformations(string s, int t) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<int> freq(26);  // freq[i]: count of character 'a' + i

        // Initialize frequency array based on input string
        for (char c : s)
            ++freq[c - 'a'];

        while (t--) {
            // The number of 'z's will wrap around to 'a'
            long long zCount = freq[25];

            // Shift all counts rightward by one letter (from 'y' to 'z', ..., 'a' to 'b')
            for (int i = 24; i >= 0; --i)
                freq[i + 1] = freq[i];

            // Update count of 'a' to zCount (wrapped 'z's)
            freq[0] = zCount % MOD;

            // Update count of 'b' to include both original 'b' and new 'a' contributions
            freq[1] = (freq[1] + zCount) % MOD;
        }

        // Sum all frequencies modulo MOD
        long long totalLength = 0;
        for (int count : freq)
            totalLength = (totalLength + count) % MOD;

        return totalLength;
    }
};
