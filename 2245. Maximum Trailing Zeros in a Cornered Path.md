You are given a 2D integer array **grid** of size **m x n**, where each cell contains a positive integer.

A **cornered path** is defined as a set of adjacent cells with **at most** one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either **horizontally** or **vertically** up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the **alternate** direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.

The **product** of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.

Return the **maximum** number of **trailing zeros** in the product of a cornered path found in grid.

Note:

- Horizontal movement means moving in either the left or right direction.
- Vertical movement means moving in either the up or down direction.

## My Solution

1. A good observation: any tailing 0 must come from a factor of 10, which in turn must come from a factor of 2 and a factor of 5.
   number of factor of 10 = min(number of factor of 2, number of factor of 5)
2. A *cornered path* is literally equal to a *vertical path* and a *horizontal path* jointed at some cell (*i*, *j*).
3. This code appears lengthy, but the logic is plain. I deliberatelly put it this way to make it easy to read.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void print(vector<vector<int>> &m)
    {
        for (auto &r : m)
        {
            for (auto c : r)
                cout << setw(3) << c;
            cout << endl;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    
    int maxTrailingZeros(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> five(m, vector<int>(n));
        vector<vector<int>> two(m, vector<int>(n));
        vector<vector<int>> row_pre_two(m, vector<int>(n + 1));
        vector<vector<int>> col_pre_two(m + 1, vector<int>(n));
        vector<vector<int>> row_pre_five(m, vector<int>(n + 1));
        vector<vector<int>> col_pre_five(m + 1, vector<int>(n));
