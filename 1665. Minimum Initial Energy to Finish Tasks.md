# Hard

You are given an array $tasks$ where $tasks[i] = [actual_i, minimum_i]$:

- $actual_i$ is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the $i$-th task.
- $minimum_i$ is the minimum amount of energy you require to begin the $i$-th task.

You can finish the tasks in any order you like.

Return the minimum initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumEffort(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
        int ans = 0;
        
        for (auto& t : tasks)
            t[0] = t[1] - t[0];

        sort(begin(tasks), end(tasks));

        for (auto& t : tasks)
            ans = max(ans + t[1] - t[0], t[1]);

        return ans;
    }
};
```
