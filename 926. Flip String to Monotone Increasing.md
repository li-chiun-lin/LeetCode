A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of $0$'s (possibly none), followed by some number of $1$'s (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string $s$. You can flip $s[i]$ changing it from $0$ to $1$ or from $1$ to $0$.

Return the minimum number of flips to make $s$ monotone increasing.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlipsMonoIncr(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> prefix(n + 1);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + (s[i] == '1' ? 1 : 0);
        
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
            ans = min(ans, prefix[i] + n - i - (prefix[n] - prefix[i]));
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
