# Medium

You have an initial power of $power$, an initial score of $0$, and a bag of $tokens$ where $tokens[i]$ is the value of the $i$-th token (0-indexed).

Your goal is to maximize your total score by potentially playing each token in one of two ways:

- If your current power is at least $tokens[i]$, you may play the $i$-th token face up, losing $tokens[i]$ power and gaining $1$ score.
- If your current score is at least $1$, you may play the $i$-th token face down, gaining $tokens[i]$ power and losing $1$ score.

Each token may be played at most once and in any order. You do not have to play all the tokens.

Return the largest possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bagOfTokensScore(vector<int>& tokens, int power) {
        sort(begin(tokens), end(tokens));
        int n = tokens.size();
        int l = 0;
        int r = n - 1;
        int s = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        
        while (l <= r && (power >= tokens[l] || s > 0))
        {
            while (l <= r && power >= tokens[l])
            {
                power -= tokens[l ++];
                ++ s;
            }
            
            ret = max(ret, s);
            
            if (l <= r && s > 0)
            {
                power += tokens[r --];
                -- s;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
