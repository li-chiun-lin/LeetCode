# Hard

A scenic location is represented by its **name** and attractiveness **score**, where **name** is a unique string among all locations and **score** is an integer. Locations can be ranked from the best to the worst. The higher the score, the better the location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the lexicographically smaller name is better.

You are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports:

- **Adding** scenic locations, one at a time.
- **Querying** the **i**-th best location of all locations already added, where **i** is the number of times the system has been queried (including the current query).
  - For example, when the system is queried for the **4**-th time, it returns the **4**-th best location of all locations already added.

Note that the test data are generated so that at any time, the number of queries does not exceed the number of locations added to the system.

Implement the **SORTracker** class:

- **SORTracker()** Initializes the tracker system.
- **void add(string name, int score)** Adds a scenic location with **name** and **score** to the system.
- **string get()** Queries and returns the **i**-th best location, where **i** is the number of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation).

struct mycmp
{
    bool operator()(pair<int, string> const &a, pair<int, string> const &b)
    {
        if (a.first == b.first)
            return a.second > b.second;

        return a.first < b.first;
    }
};

struct mycmp2
{
    bool operator()(pair<int, string> const &a, pair<int, string> const &b)
    {
        if (a.first == b.first)
            return a.second < b.second;

        return a.first > b.first;
    }
};

class SORTracker {
    priority_queue<
        pair<int, string>, 
        vector<pair<int, string>>, 
        mycmp

    priority_queue<
        pair<int, string>, 
        vector<pair<int, string>>, 
        mycmp2
        > best;
    
    int q;
    
public:
    SORTracker() {
        q = 1;
    }
    
    void add(string name, int score) {
        best.push({ score, name });

        if (best.size() > q)
        {
            rest.push(best.top());
            best.pop();
        }
    }
    
    string get() {
        string r = best.top().second;

        ++q;

        if (best.size() < q && rest.size())
        {
            best.push(rest.top());
            rest.pop();
        }

        return r;
