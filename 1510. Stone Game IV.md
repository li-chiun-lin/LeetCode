# Hard

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are $n$ stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer $n$, return $true$ if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return $false$, assuming both players play optimally.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        vector<bool> dp(n + 1);
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
            for (int k = 1, kk = 1; kk <= i; ++k, kk = k * k)
                if (dp[i -  kk] == false)
                {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
