You are given a 2D integer array $points$, where $points[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ represents the coordinates of the $i$-th point on the Cartesian plane.

A horizontal trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of horizontal sides (i.e. parallel to the x-axis). Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

Return the number of unique horizontal trapezoids that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from $points$.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTrapezoids(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        // Map from y-coordinate to set of x-values (points on that horizontal line)
        map<int, set<int>> y_to_xs;

        // Map from y-coordinate to number of horizontal segments C(n,2)
        map<int, long long> segmentsPerY;

        // Step 1: Group all x-values for each y-level
        for (auto& point : points) {
            int x = point[0], y = point[1];
            y_to_xs[y].insert(x);
        }

        long long totalSegments = 0;

        // Step 2: For each horizontal line, compute number of segments C(n,2)
        for (auto& [y, xset] : y_to_xs) {
            long long count = xset.size();
            if (count >= 2) {
                long long segmentCount = count * (count - 1) / 2 % MOD;
                segmentsPerY[y] = segmentCount;
                totalSegments = (totalSegments + segmentCount) % MOD;
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Count total trapezoid pairs between different y-lines
        // For each level y: segmentCount * (total - segmentCount)
        long long result = 0;
        for (auto& [y, segmentCount] : segmentsPerY) {
            long long others = (totalSegments - segmentCount + MOD) % MOD;
            result = (result + segmentCount * others % MOD) % MOD;
        }

        // Final step: divide by 2 to account for overcounting (each pair counted twice)
        const long long INV2 = 500000004; // modular inverse of 2 mod 1e9+7
        return result * INV2 % MOD;
    }
};
