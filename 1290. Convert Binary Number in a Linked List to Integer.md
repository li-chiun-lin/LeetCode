# Easy

Given $head$ which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either $0$ or $1$. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getDecimalValue(ListNode* head) {
        int result = 0;

        // Traverse the linked list and treat it as a binary number
        while (head) {
            result = (result << 1) | head->val;  // Shift left and add current bit
            head = head->next;                   // Move to the next node
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
