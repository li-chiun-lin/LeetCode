# Easy

Given $head$ which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either $0$ or $1$. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getDecimalValue(ListNode* head) {
        int ret = 0;
        
        while (head)
        {
            ret <<= 1;
            ret |= head->val;
            head = head->next;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
