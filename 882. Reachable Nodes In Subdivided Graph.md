# Hard

You are given an undirected graph (the "original graph") with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$. You decide to subdivide each edge in the graph into a chain of nodes, with the number of new nodes varying between each edge.

The graph is given as a 2D array of $edges$ where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, cnt_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$ in the original graph, and $cnt_i$ is the total number of new nodes that you will subdivide the edge into. Note that $cnt_i == 0$ means you will not subdivide the edge.

To subdivide the edge $[u_i, v_i]$, replace it with $(cnt_i + 1)$ new edges and $cnt_i$ new nodes. The new nodes are $x_1, x_2, ..., x_{cnt_i}$, and the new edges are $[u_i, x_1], [x_1, x_2], [x_2, x_3], ..., [x_{cnt_{i-1}}, x_{cnt_i}], [x_{cnt_i}, v_i]$.

In this new graph, you want to know how many nodes are reachable from the node $0$, where a node is reachable if the distance is $maxMoves$ or less.

Given the original graph and $maxMoves$, return the number of nodes that are reachable from node $0$ in the new graph.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reachableNodes(vector<vector<int>>& edges, int maxMoves, int n) {
        map<int, map<int, int>> e;

        for (auto& x : edges)
            e[x[0]][x[1]] = e[x[1]][x[0]] = x[2];
        
        vector<int> visited(n, -1);
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
        pq.push({maxMoves, 0});

        while (size(pq))
        {
            auto [m, u] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            if (visited[u] != -1)
                continue;
            
            visited[u] = m;

            for (auto& [v, cut] : e[u])
                if (m - cut - 1 >= 0 && visited[v] == -1)
                    pq.push({m - cut - 1, v});
        }

        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (visited[i] != -1)
                ++ ans;

        for (auto& x : edges)
        {
            int a = visited[x[0]] == -1 ? 0 : visited[x[0]];
            int b = visited[x[1]] == -1 ? 0 : visited[x[1]];
            ans += min(a + b, x[2]);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
