A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Design an algorithm to insert a new node to a complete binary tree keeping it complete after the insertion.

Implement the **CBTInserter** class:

- **CBTInserter(TreeNode root)** Initializes the data structure with the $root$ of the complete binary tree.
- **int insert(int v)** Inserts a **TreeNode** into the tree with value $Node.val == val$ so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the inserted **TreeNode**.
- **TreeNode get_root()** Returns the root node of the tree.

```cpp
class CBTInserter {
    queue<TreeNode*> que;
    TreeNode* r;
    
public:
    CBTInserter(TreeNode* root) {
        r = root;
        que.push(root);
        
        // BFS untill we find an incomplete node
        while (que.size())
        {
            auto u = que.front();
            
            if (u->left)
                que.push(u->left);
            else
                break;
            
            if (u->right)
                que.push(u->right);
            else
                break;
            
            que.pop();
        }
    }
    
    int insert(int val) {
        TreeNode* n = new TreeNode(val);
        TreeNode* u = que.front();
        
        // if the current node already have left subtree, 
        // we set the new node to its right subtree,
        // since it has two subtrees, we pop it.
        if (u->left)
        {
            u->right = n;
            que.pop();
        }
        // otherwise, we set the new node to its left subtree
        // the current node is stil missing its right subtree, but the whole tree is complete.
        else
        {
            u->left = n;
        }
        
        que.push(n);
        
        return u->val;
    }
    
    TreeNode* get_root() {
        return r;
    }
};
```
