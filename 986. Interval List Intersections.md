You are given two lists of closed intervals, $firstList$ and $secondList$, where $firstList[i] = [start_i, end_i]$ and $secondList[j] = [start_j, end_j]$. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A closed interval $[a, b]$ (with $a \leq b$) denotes the set of real numbers $x$ with $a \leq x \leq b$.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> intervalIntersection(vector<vector<int>>& f, vector<vector<int>>& s) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;
        
        while (i < f.size() && j < s.size())
        {
            a = max(f[i][0], s[j][0]);
            b = min(f[i][1], s[j][1]);
            
            if (a <= b)
                ret.push_back({a, b});
            
            if (f[i][1] < s[j][1])
                ++ i;
            else
                ++ j;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
