# Medium

You are given an array $prices$ where $prices[i]$ is the price of a given stock on the $i$-th day, and an integer $fee$ representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(vector<int>& p, int f, int d, bool b, vector<vector<int>> &dp) {
        if (d >= p.size())
            return 0;
        
        if (dp[d][b])
            return dp[d][b];
        
        int r1 = dfs(p, f, d + 1, b, dp);
        int r2 = 0;
        
        if (b)
            r2 = -p[d] + dfs(p, f, d + 1, !b, dp);
        else
            r2 = p[d] + dfs(p, f, d + 1, !b, dp) - f;
        
        return dp[d][b] = max(r1, r2);
    }
    
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(2));
        
        return dfs(prices, fee, 0, true, dp);
    }
};
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int sell = 0;
        int buy = -prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i)
        {
            sell = max(sell, buy + prices[i] - fee);
            buy = max(buy, sell - prices[i]);
        }
        
        return sell;
    }
};
