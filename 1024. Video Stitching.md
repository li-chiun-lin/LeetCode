# Medium

You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted $time$ seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.

Each video clip is described by an array $clips$ where $clips[i] = [start_i, end_i]$ indicates that the $i$-th clip started at $start_i$ and ended at $end_i$.

We can cut these clips into segments freely.

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event $[0, time]$. If the task is impossible, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int videoStitching(vector<vector<int>>& clips, int time) {
        sort(begin(clips), end(clips));

        int ans = 0;
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int i = 0;

        while (start < time)
        {
            while (i < clips.size() && clips[i][0] <= start)
                end = max(end, clips[i ++][1]);

            if (start == end)
                return -1;

            start = end;
            ++ ans;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
