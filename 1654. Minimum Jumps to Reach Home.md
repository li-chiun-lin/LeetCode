# Medium

A certain bug's home is on the x-axis at position $x$. Help them get there from position $0$.

The bug jumps according to the following rules:

- It can jump exactly $a$ positions forward (to the right).
- It can jump exactly $b$ positions backward (to the left).
- It cannot jump backward twice in a row.
- It cannot jump to any forbidden positions.

The bug may jump forward beyond its home, but it cannot jump to positions numbered with negative integers.

Given an array of integers $forbidden$, where $forbidden[i]$ means that the bug cannot jump to the position $forbidden[i]$, and integers $a$, $b$, and $x$, return the minimum number of jumps needed for the bug to reach its home. If there is no possible sequence of jumps that lands the bug on position $x$, return $-1$.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumJumps(vector<int>& forbidden, int a, int b, int x) {
        // Map to track visited positions; true indicates visited
        map<int, bool> visited;

        // Find the farthest relevant position to limit the search space
        int maxLimit = 0;
        for (int pos : forbidden) {
            visited[pos] = true; // Mark forbidden positions as visited
            maxLimit = max(maxLimit, pos);
        }
        // The furthest position the bug needs to consider is influenced by max(forbidden) and x
        maxLimit = max(maxLimit, x) + a + b;

        // BFS setup
        queue<pair<int, bool>> que; // {position, can_jump_backward}
        que.push({0, true});       // Start at position 0 with the ability to jump backward
        visited[0] = true;         // Mark the starting position as visited

        int jumps = 0; // Track the number of jumps

        // BFS loop
        while (!que.empty()) {
            int size = que.size(); // Process all nodes at the current depth level
            while (size--) {
                auto [pos, canJumpBackward] = que.front();
                que.pop();

                // If the target position is reached, return the jump count
                if (pos == x) 
                    return jumps;

                // Jump backward
                int back = pos - b;
                if (canJumpBackward && back >= 0 && !visited[back]) {
                    que.push({back, false}); // After a backward jump, can't jump backward again
                    visited[back] = true;
                }

                // Jump forward
                int forward = pos + a;
                if (forward <= maxLimit && !visited[forward]) {
                    que.push({forward, true}); // Can jump backward after a forward jump
                    visited[forward] = true;
                }
            }
            ++jumps; // Increment the jump count after processing all nodes at this level
        }

        // If the queue is empty and we haven't reached the target, return -1
        return -1;
    }
};
