You are given a 2D integer array $coordinates$ and an integer $k$, where $coordinates[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ are the coordinates of the $i$-th point in a 2D plane.

We define the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ as $(x_1 \oplus x_2) + (y_1 \oplus y_2)$ where $\oplus$ is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the number of pairs $(i, j)$ such that $i < j$ and the distance between points $i$ and $j$ is equal to $k$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(vector<vector<int>>& coordinates, int k) {
        map<pair<int, int>, int> mp;
        int ret = 0;

        for (auto& c : coordinates)
        {
            /*
            dx = x1 ^ x2       --- (1)
            dy = y1 ^ y2       --- (2)
            dx + dy = k        --- (3)

            (1) can be rewrite to
            x2 = dx ^ x1       --- (4)

            from (3) we have
            dy = k - dx, 
            thus, (2) can be rewrite to
            k - dx = y1 ^ y2, 
            y2 = (k - dx) ^ y1 --- (5)

            from (3) we have
            0 <= dx <= k       --- (6)

            we count the number of (x2, y2) for 0 <= dx <= k.
            */

            int x1 = c[0];
            int y1 = c[1];

            for (int dx = 0; dx <= k; ++dx)
                ret += mp[{dx ^ x1, (k - dx) ^ y1}];

            ++ mp[{x1, y1}];
        }

        return ret;
    }
