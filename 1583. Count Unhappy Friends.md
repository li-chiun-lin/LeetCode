# Medium

You are given a list of $preferences$ for $n$ friends, where $n$ is always even.

For each person $i$, $preferences[i]$ contains a list of friends sorted in the order of preference. In other words, a friend earlier in the list is more preferred than a friend later in the list. Friends in each list are denoted by integers from $0$ to $n-1$.

All the friends are divided into pairs. The pairings are given in a list $pairs$, where $pairs[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ denotes $x_i$ is paired with $y_i$ and $y_i$ is paired with $x_i$.

However, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. A friend $x$ is unhappy if $x$ is paired with $y$ and there exists a friend $u$ who is paired with $v$ but:

- $x$ prefers $u$ over $y$, and
- $u$ prefers $x$ over $v$.

Return the number of unhappy friends.

                    continue;
