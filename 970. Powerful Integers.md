Given three integers $x$, $y$, and $bound$, return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to $bound$.

An integer is powerful if it can be represented as $x^i + y^j$ for some integers $i \geq 0$ and $j \geq 0$.

You may return the answer in any order. In your answer, each value should occur at most once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> powerfulIntegers(int x, int y, int bound) {
        vector<int> ret;
        
        // corner case 1:
        if (x == 1 && y == 1)
        {
            if (x + y <= bound)
                ret.push_back(x + y);
        }
        // corner case 2:
        else if (x == 1 || y == 1)
        {
            int xy = x * y;
            int b = 1;
            
            while (1 + b <= bound)
            {
                ret.push_back(b + 1);
                b *= xy;
            }
        }
        // general case:
        else
        {
            set<int> ss;
            
            for (int a = 1; a < bound; a *= x)
                for (int b = 1; a + b <= bound; b *= y)
                    ss.insert(a + b);
            
            for (int x : ss)
                ret.push_back(x);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
