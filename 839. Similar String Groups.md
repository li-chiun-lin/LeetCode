Two strings $X$ and $Y$ are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of $X$, so that it equals $Y$. Also two strings $X$ and $Y$ are similar if they are equal.

For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list $strs$ of strings where every string in $strs$ is an anagram of every other string in $strs$. How many groups are there?

```cpp
class Solution {
    int find(vector<int>& g, int x)
    {
        if (g[x] != x)
            g[x] = find(g, g[x]);

        return g[x];
    }

    bool join(vector<int>& g, int x, int y)
    {
        int gx = find(g, x);
        int gy = find(g, y);

        if (gx == gy)
            return false;

        g[gx] = gy;
        return true;
    }

    bool check(string& a, string& b)
    {
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < a.size() && cnt <= 2; ++i)
            if (a[i] != b[i])
                ++ cnt;

        return cnt <= 2;
    }

public:
    int numSimilarGroups(vector<string>& strs) {
        int n = strs.size();
        vector<int> g(n);
        int ret = n;

        iota(begin(g), end(g), 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j)
                if (check(strs[i], strs[j]))
                    if (join(g, i, j))
                        -- ret;

        return ret;
    }
};
```
