You are given a 0-indexed array $nums$ of length $n$, consisting of non-negative integers. For each index $i$ from $0$ to $n - 1$, you must determine the size of the minimum sized non-empty subarray of $nums$ starting at $i$ (inclusive) that has the maximum possible bitwise OR.

In other words, let $B_{ij}$ be the bitwise OR of the subarray $nums[i \dots j]$. You need to find the smallest subarray starting at $i$, such that bitwise OR of this subarray is equal to $max(B_{ik})$ where $i \leq k \leq n - 1$.

The bitwise OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in it.

Return an integer array $answer$ of size $n$ where $answer[i]$ is the length of the minimum sized subarray starting at $i$ with maximum bitwise OR.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

            for (int b = 0; b < 32; ++b, mask <<= 1)
                if (nums[i] & mask)
                    ++ bit[b];

                    // the nums[j] are not entirly covered by other elements between i and j.
                    // since the only b-th bit must come from nums[j].
