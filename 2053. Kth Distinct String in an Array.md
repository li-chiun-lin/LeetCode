A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.

Given an array of strings **arr**, and an integer **k**, return the **k**-th distinct string present in **arr**. If there are fewer than **k** distinct strings, return an empty string **""**.

Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string kthDistinct(vector<string>& arr, int k) {
        map<string, int> hit;
        
        for (string &s : arr)
            ++ hit[s];
        
        for (string &s : arr)
        {
            if (hit[s] != 1)
                continue;
            
            if (-- k == 0)
                return s;
        }
        
        return "";
    }
};
```
