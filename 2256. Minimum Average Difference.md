You are given a 0-indexed integer array **nums** of length **n**.

The average difference of the index **i** is the absolute difference between the average of the first **i + 1** elements of nums and the average of the last **n - i - 1** elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.

Note:

- The absolute difference of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.
- The average of **n** elements is the sum of the **n** elements divided (integer division) by **n**.
- The average of **0** elements is considered to be **0**.

## My solution

1. Caulate the total sum of the whole array.
2. While iterate through the array, accumulate each element as the sum of the left part, and use *total sum - left sum* as the right sum to avoid repeated calculation.
3. The rest are just do as the question required.
4. Mind the large test cases.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumAverageDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long sum = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // the accumulate() can not handle all the test cases.
        for (int x : nums)
            sum += x;
        
        long long left = 0;
        long long right = 0;
        long long avg1 = 0;
        long long avg2 = 0;
        long long mm = INT_MAX;
        long long aa = 0;
        int idx = -1;
        
        // I don't handle the last element here so that I don't have to worry about the 'divided by zero' issue.
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i)
        {
            left += nums[i];
            right = sum - left;
            
            avg1 = left / (i + 1);
            avg2 = right / (n - i - 1);
            
            aa = abs(avg1 - avg2);
            
            if (mm > aa)
            {
                mm = aa;
                idx = i;
            }
        }
        
        // handle the last element here.
        long long avg3 = sum / n;
        
        if (mm > avg3)
            idx = n - 1;
        
        return idx;
    }
};
```
