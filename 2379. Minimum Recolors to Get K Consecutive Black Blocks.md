# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed string $blocks$ of length $n$, where $blocks[i]$ is either 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the $i$th block. The characters 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.

You are also given an integer $k$, which is the desired number of consecutive black blocks.

In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a black block.

Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least one occurrence of $k$ consecutive black blocks.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    int minimumRecolors(string blocks, int k) 
    {
        int whiteCount = 0;  // Count of 'W' in the current window of size k
        int minRecolors = INT_MAX;  // Stores the minimum number of recolors required
        
        // Initialize the count of 'W' in the first window of size k
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) 
        {
            if (blocks[i] == 'W') 
            {
                ++whiteCount;
            }
        }

        minRecolors = whiteCount;  // Set initial minimum recolors
        
        // Slide the window across the string
        for (int i = k; i < blocks.size(); ++i) 
        {
            // Remove the leftmost element from the window
            if (blocks[i - k] == 'W') 
            {
                --whiteCount;
            }

            // Add the new rightmost element to the window
            if (blocks[i] == 'W') 
            {
                ++whiteCount;
            }

            // Update the minimum recolors needed
            minRecolors = min(minRecolors, whiteCount);
        }
        
        return minRecolors;
    }
};
```
