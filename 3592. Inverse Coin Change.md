You are given a 1-indexed integer array $numWays$, where $numWays[i]$ represents the number of ways to select a total amount $i$ using an infinite supply of some fixed coin denominations. Each denomination is a positive integer with value at most $numWays.length$.

However, the exact coin denominations have been lost. Your task is to recover the set of denominations that could have resulted in the given $numWays$ array.

Return a sorted array containing unique integers which represents this set of denominations.

If no such set exists, return an empty array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findCoins(vector<int>& numWays) {
        int n = numWays.size();
        vector<int> result;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // If there's exactly 1 way to form sum i, then (i + 1) is a coin
            if (numWays[i] == 1) {
                int coin = i + 1;

                // Remove the contribution of this coin from all higher sums
                for (int s = n - 1; s - coin >= coin - 1; --s)
                    numWays[s] -= numWays[s - coin];

                result.push_back(coin);
                numWays[i] = 0; // Clear to avoid double-counting
            }
        }

        // After removing all coin effects, numWays should be all zero
        for (int ways : numWays)
            if (ways != 0)
                return {}; // Invalid - cannot be explained by selected coins

        return result;
    }
};
```
