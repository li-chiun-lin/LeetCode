You are given 2 positive integers $l$ and $r$. For any number $x$, all positive divisors of $x$ except $x$ are called the proper divisors of $x$.

A number is called special if it has exactly 2 proper divisors. For example:

- The number 4 is special because it has proper divisors 1 and 2.
- The number 6 is not special because it has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3.

Return the count of numbers in the range $[l, r]$ that are not special.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int nonSpecialCount(int l, int r) {
        int rr = sqrt(r);
        int cnt = 0;

        vector<bool> sieve(rr + 1, true);
        
        for (long long i = 2; i <= rr; ++i)
            if (sieve[i])
            {
                for (long long j = i * i; j <= rr; j += i)
                    sieve[j] = false;

                if (l <= i * i)
                    ++ cnt;
            }
        
        return r - l + 1 - cnt;     
    }
};
```
