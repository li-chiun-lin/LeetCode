You are given an array of positive integers $nums$ of length $n$.

A polygon is a closed plane figure that has at least 3 sides. The longest side of a polygon is smaller than the sum of its other sides.

Conversely, if you have $k \geq 3$ positive real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k$ where $a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq ... \leq a_k$ and $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_{k-1} > a_k$, then there always exists a polygon with $k$ sides whose lengths are $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k$.

The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of lengths of its sides.

Return the largest possible perimeter of a polygon whose sides can be formed from $nums$, or $-1$ if it is not possible to create a polygon.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long largestPerimeter(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long accu = accumulate(begin(nums), end(nums), 0LL);
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));
        
        for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 2; --i)
            if ((accu -= nums[i]) > nums[i])
                return accu + nums[i];
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```
