# Easy

Given a string $s$ containing only digits, return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after swapping adjacent digits in s with the same parity at most once.

Digits have the same parity if both are odd or both are even. For example, 5 and 9, as well as 2 and 4, have the same parity, while 6 and 9 do not.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(string s) {
        for (int i = 1; i < size(s); ++i)
            if (s[i - 1] % 2 == s[i] % 2 && s[i - 1] > s[i])
            {
                swap(s[i - 1], s[i]);
                break;
            }
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
