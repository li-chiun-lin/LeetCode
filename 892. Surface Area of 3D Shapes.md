# Easy

You are given an $n \times n$ $grid$ where you have placed some $1 \times 1 \times 1$ cubes. Each value $v = grid[i] [j]$ represents a tower of $v$ cubes placed on top of cell $(i, j)$.

After placing these cubes, you have decided to glue any directly adjacent cubes to each other, forming several irregular 3D shapes.

Return the total surface area of the resulting shapes.

Note: The bottom face of each shape counts toward its surface area.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int surfaceArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int s = 0;
        
        // the overall suface if we do not consider the area that will be glued.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                if (grid[i][j])
                    // 4 vertical sides plus top and botton area
                    s += grid[i][j] * 4 + 2;
        
        // cosider the north and south surface that must be glued
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j)
                // glue both sides
                s -= min(grid[i][j], grid[i][j - 1]) * 2;
        
         
        // consider the east and west surface that must be glued
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
                // glue both sides
                s -= min(grid[i][j], grid[i - 1][j]) * 2;
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
