You are given two strings **word1** and **word2**. You want to construct a string **merge** in the following way: while either **word1** or **word2** are non-empty, choose one of the following options:

- If **word1** is non-empty, append the first character in **word1** to **merge** and delete it from **word1**.
- If **word2** is non-empty, append the first character in **word2** to **merge** and delete it from **word2**.

Return the lexicographically largest **merge** you can construct.

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool isLarger(string &w1, string &w2, int i, int j)
    {
        while (i < w1.size() && j < w2.size())
        {
            if (w1[i] > w2[j])
                return true;
            else if (w1[i] < w2[j])
                return false;
            
            ++ i;
            ++ j;
        }
        
        return i < w1.size();
    }
    
public:
    string largestMerge(string word1, string word2) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        string ret = "";
        
        while (i < word1.size() && j < word2.size())
        {
            if (isLarger(word1, word2, i, j))
                ret.push_back(word1[i ++]);
            else
                ret.push_back(word2[j ++]);
        }
        
        while (i < word1.size())
            ret.push_back(word1[i ++]);
        
        while (j < word2.size())
            ret.push_back(word2[j ++]);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
