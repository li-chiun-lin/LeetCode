# Easy

There are **n** rings and each ring is either red, green, or blue. The rings are distributed across ten rods labeled from **0** to **9**.

You are given a string **rings** of length **2n** that describes the **n** rings that are placed onto the rods. Every two characters in **rings** forms a color-position pair that is used to describe each ring where:

- The first character of the **i**-th pair denotes the **i**-th ring's color **('R', 'G', 'B')**.
- The second character of the **i**-th pair denotes the rod that the **i**-th ring is placed on **('0' to '9')**.

For example, "**R3G2B1**" describes **n == 3** rings: a red ring placed onto the rod labeled **3**, a green ring placed onto the rod labeled **2**, and a blue ring placed onto the rod labeled **1**.

Return the number of rods that have all three colors of rings on them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPoints(string rings) {
        vector<int> rod(10);
        int c = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rings.size() - 1; i += 2)
        {
            int idx = rings[i + 1] - '0';
            
            if (rings[i] == 'R')
                rod[idx] |= 1;
            else if (rings[i] == 'G')
                rod[idx] |= 2;
            else
                rod[idx] |= 4;    
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
            c += rod[i] == 7;
        
        return c;
    }
};
```
