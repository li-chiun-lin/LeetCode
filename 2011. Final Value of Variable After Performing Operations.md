# Easy

There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable **X**:

- **++X** and **X++** increments the value of the variable **X** by **1**.
- **--X** and **X--** decrements the value of the variable **X** by **1**.

Initially, the value of **X** is **0**.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of **X** after performing all the operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (string &s : operations)
        {
            if (s[1] == '-')
                -- sum;
            else
                ++ sum;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
