Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string $s$, split it into some number of substrings such that each substring is balanced.

Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int balancedStringSplit(string s) {
        int lr = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
        {
            if (s[i] == 'R')
                ++ lr;
            else
                -- lr;
            
            cnt += lr == 0;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
