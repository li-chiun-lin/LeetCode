# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array **flowers**, where **flowers[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]** means the **i**-th flower will be in full bloom from **start<sub>i</sub>** to **end<sub>i</sub>** (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array **persons** of size **n**, where **persons[i]** is the time that the **i**-th person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return an integer array **answer** of size **n**, where **answer[i]** is the number of flowers that are in full bloom when the **i**-th person arrives.

## My Solution

1. Use a map to mark the **start** and **end** of every flower.
1. Accumulate every mark to a table for indicating how many flowers at each time.
1. Use **upper_bound()** with the arriving time of every person. \
    **upper_bound()** returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the container whose key is considered to go after **k**. \
    Then move the iterator one step back, that will be the answer we are looking for. \
    The corner case when the iterator points to the **begin()** of the map, then the answer will be **0**.
