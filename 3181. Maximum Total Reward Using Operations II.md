# Hard

You are given an integer array $rewardValues$ of length $n$, representing the values of rewards.

Initially, your total reward $x$ is $0$, and all indices are unmarked. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose an unmarked index $i$ from the range $[0, n - 1]$.
- If $rewardValues[i]$ is greater than your current total reward $x$, then add $rewardValues[i]$ to $x$, and mark the index $i$.

Return an integer denoting the maximum total reward you can collect by performing the operations optimally.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxTotalReward(vector<int>& rewardValues) {
        bitset<100001> dp;
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int x : set<int>(begin(rewardValues), end(rewardValues)))
        {
            int s = 1e5 - x + 1;
            dp |= dp << s >> s << x;
        }

        int ans = 1e5;

        while (dp[ans] == 0)
            -- ans;

        return ans;

    }
};
```
