# Medium

You are given an integer array $nums$ of size $n$ and a positive integer $k$.

An array capped by value $x$ is obtained by replacing every element $nums[i]$ with $\min(nums[i], x)$.

For each integer $x$ from $1$ to $n$, determine whether it is possible to choose a subsequence from the array capped by $x$ such that the sum of the chosen elements is exactly $k$.

Return a 0-indexed boolean array $answer$ of size $n$, where $answer[i]$ is $true$ if it is possible when using $x = i + 1$, and $false$ otherwise.
