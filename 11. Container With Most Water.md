# Medium

You are given an integer array $height$ of length $n$. There are $n$ vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the $i$-th line are $(i, 0)$ and $(i, height[i])$.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        int area = 0;
        
        while (left < right)
        {
            if (height[left] < height[right])
            {
                area = max(area, height[left] * (right - left));
                ++ left;
            }
            else
            {
                area = max(area, height[right] * (right - left));
                -- right;
            }
        }
        
        return area;
    }
};
```
