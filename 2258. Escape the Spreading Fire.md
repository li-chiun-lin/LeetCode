# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array **grid** of size **m x n** which represents a field. Each cell has one of three values:

- **0** represents grass,
- **1** represents fire,
- **2** represents a wall that you and fire cannot pass through.

You are situated in the top-left cell, **(0, 0)**, and you want to travel to the safehouse at the bottom-right cell, **(m - 1, n - 1)**. Every minute, you may move to an adjacent grass cell. After your move, every fire cell will spread to all adjacent cells that are not walls.

Return the **maximum** number of minutes that you can stay in your initial position before moving while still safely reaching the safehouse. If this is impossible, return **-1**. If you can always reach the safehouse regardless of the minutes stayed, return $10^9$.

Note that even if the fire spreads to the safehouse immediately after you have reached it, it will be counted as safely reaching the safehouse.

A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).

## My Solution

1. After first BFS, we have the information about the time of the fire spread to each grass cell.
2. In the second BFS, we try to find a grass path to safehouse, but with one more condition that the current cell in the possible path must still minutes away from fire, i.e. **burn[ii][jj] >= cd**.
3. The minimum value of **burn[ii][jj] - cd** for each cell in a path to safehouse is the spare time we can stay at initial position and still can reach safehouse in time.
4. the maximum value of the above mentioned spare time for all the possible pathes is the answer to this question.
