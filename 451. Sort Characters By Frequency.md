Given a string $s$, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        map<char, int> freq;
        
        for (char c : s)
            ++ freq[c];
        
        priority_queue<pair<int, char>> pq;
        
        for (auto &p : freq)
            pq.push({p.second, p.first});
        
        string ret = "";
        
        while (pq.size())
        {
            ret += string(pq.top().first, pq.top().second);
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
