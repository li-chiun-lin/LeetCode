You are given an integer $limit$ and a 2D array $queries$ of size $n \times 2$.

There are $limit + 1$ balls with distinct labels in the range $[0, limit]$. Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in $queries$ that is of the form $[x, y]$, you mark ball $x$ with the color $y$. After each query, you need to find the number of distinct colors among the balls.

Return an array $result$ of length $n$, where $result[i]$ denotes the number of distinct colors after $i$-th query.

Note that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> queryResults(int limit, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        map<int, int> col;
        map<int, int> cnt;
        vector<int> ans;
        
        for (auto& q : queries)
        {
            int x = q[0];
            int y = q[1];
            
            if (col.count(x))
            {
                if (-- cnt[col[x]] == 0)
                    cnt.erase(col[x]);
            }
            
            col[x] = y;
            ++ cnt[y];
            
            ans.push_back(size(cnt));
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
