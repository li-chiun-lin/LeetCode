You are given an integer $limit$ and a 2D array $queries$ of size $n \times 2$.

There are $limit + 1$ balls with distinct labels in the range $[0, limit]$. Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in $queries$ that is of the form $[x, y]$, you mark ball $x$ with the color $y$. After each query, you need to find the number of distinct colors among the balls.

Return an array $result$ of length $n$, where $result[i]$ denotes the number of distinct colors after $i$-th query.

Note that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    vector<int> queryResults(int limit, vector<vector<int>>& queries)
    {
        map<int, int> colorMapping; // Maps index to color
        map<int, int> colorCount;   // Tracks the count of each color
        vector<int> result;

        for (auto& query : queries)
        {
            int index = query[0];
            int color = query[1];

            // If index already has a color, decrement its count
            if (colorMapping.count(index))
            {
                if (--colorCount[colorMapping[index]] == 0)
                {
                    colorCount.erase(colorMapping[index]);
                }
            }

            // Assign new color and increment its count
            colorMapping[index] = color;
            ++colorCount[color];

            // Store the number of unique colors in result
            result.push_back(colorCount.size());
        }

        return result;
    }
};
