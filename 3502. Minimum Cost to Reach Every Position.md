# Easy

You are given an integer array $cost$ of size $n$. You are currently at position $n$ (at the end of the line) in a line of $n + 1$ people (numbered from $0$ to $n$).

You wish to move forward in the line, but each person in front of you charges a specific amount to swap places. The cost to swap with person $i$ is given by $cost[i]$.

You are allowed to swap places with people as follows:

- If they are in front of you, you must pay them $cost[i]$ to swap with them.
- If they are behind you, they can swap with you for free.

Return an array $answer$ of size $n$, where $answer[i]$ is the minimum total cost to reach each position $i$ in the line.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    vector<int> minCosts(vector<int>& cost) 
    {
        int n = cost.size(); // Get the number of elements in cost
        vector<int> min_costs(n); // Result vector to store minimum costs up to each index
        int current_min = INT_MAX; // Variable to track the minimum cost encountered so far

        // Iterate through the cost array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) 
        {
            current_min = min(current_min, cost[i]); // Update the minimum cost encountered so far
            min_costs[i] = current_min; // Store the minimum cost at the current index
        }

        return min_costs; // Return the computed minimum cost array
    }
};
```
