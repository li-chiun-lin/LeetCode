# Medium

You are given a 2D integer $grid$ of size $m \times n$ and an integer $x$. In one operation, you can add $x$ to or subtract $x$ from any element in the $grid$.

A uni-value grid is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.

Return the minimum number of operations to make the grid uni-value. If it is not possible, return $-1$.

## My Solution

First of all, this question is indeed has nothing to do with the 2D, it will be easier to face it if we treat it as a 1D array.

Secondly, if we express any value $v$ in the array as $q \times x + r$, then the result could only be $v' = q' \times x + r$, since $+x$ and $-x$ are the only allowed operations.

Hence if there are more than one value of $r$ in the whole grid, then it will be impossible to make all the elements equal.

Finally, instead of attacking this problem from the prspect of value $v_i, ... ,v_n$, 
we might as well view this problem as $q_i, ... ,q_n$ where $v_i = q_i \times x + r$.

Then, the overall task will become: count the difference between each $q_i$ and the median $q_{mid}$.

Happy coding.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x) 
    {
        vector<int> values;
        int remainder = grid[0][0] % x;

        // Flatten the grid and check if all elements have the same remainder when divided by x
        for (auto& row : grid) 
        {
            for (int val : row) 
            {
                if (val % x != remainder) 
                {
                    return -1; // If remainders differ, it's impossible to make all elements equal
                }
                values.push_back(val / x); // Store the quotient to normalize values
            }
        }

        int totalElements = grid.size() * grid[0].size();
        int medianIndex = totalElements / 2;

        // Find the median element (nth_element places the median at the correct position)
        nth_element(values.begin(), values.begin() + medianIndex, values.end());
        int median = values[medianIndex];

        // Compute the total operations required to convert all values to the median
        int operations = 0;
        for (int q : values) 
        {
            operations += abs(median - q);
        }

        return operations;
    }
};
