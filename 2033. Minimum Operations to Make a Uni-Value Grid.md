# Medium

You are given a 2D integer **grid** of size **m x n** and an integer **x**. In one operation, you can **add x** to or **subtract x** from any element in the **grid**.

A **uni-value grid** is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make the grid **uni-value**. If it is not possible, return **-1**.

## My Solution

First of all, this question is indeed has nothing to do with the 2D, it will be easier to face it if we treat it as a 1D array.

Secondly, if we express any value v in the array as q * x + r, then the result could only be v' = q' * x + r, since +x and -x are the only allowed operations.

Hence if there are more than one value of r in the whole grid, then it will be impossible to make all the elements equal.

Finally, instead of attacking this problem from the prspect of value v<sub>i</sub>, ... ,v<sub>n</sub>, 
we might as well view this problem as q<sub>i</sub>, ... ,q<sub>n</sub> where v<sub>i</sub> = q<sub>i</sub> * x + r.

Then, the overall task will become: count the difference between each q<sub>i</sub> and the median q<sub>mid</sub>.

Happy coding.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x) {
        vector<int> vec;
        int r = grid[0][0] % x;
        
        for (auto &row : grid)
        {
            for (int val : row)
            {
                if (val % x != r)
                    return -1;
                
                int q = val / x;
                vec.push_back(q);
            }
        }
        
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int mid = (m * n) / 2;
        
        nth_element(vec.begin(), vec.begin() + mid, vec.end());
        
        int c = 0;
        for (int q : vec)
            c += abs(vec[mid] - q);
        
        return c;
    }
};
