# Easy

You are given a phone number as a string *number*. *number* consists of digits, spaces **' '**, and/or dashes **'-'**.

You would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, **remove** all spaces and dashes. Then, **group** the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:

- 2 digits: A single block of length 2.
- 3 digits: A single block of length 3.
- 4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.

The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should **never** produce any blocks of length 1 and produce **at most** two blocks of length 2.

Return the phone number after formatting.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reformatNumber(string number) {
        // remove non-digit
        string s1 = "";
        for (char c : number)
            if (isdigit(c))
                s1 += c;
        
        string s2 = "";
        int n = s1.size();
        int i = 0;
        
        // groups of 3
        while (n > 4)
        {
            s2 += s1.substr(i, 3) + "-";
            i += 3;
            n -= 3;
        }
    
        // final group of 2
        if (n == 4)
        {
            s2 += s1.substr(i, 2) + "-";
            i += 2;
            n -= 2;
        }
        
        // final group of 3 or 2
        return s2 + s1.substr(i, n);
    }
};
```
