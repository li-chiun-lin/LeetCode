You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$ and exactly $n - 1$ edges. The root of the tree is the node $0$, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string $labels$ (i.e. The node with the number $i$ has the label $labels[i]$).

The $edges$ array is given on the form $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$, which means there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree.

Return an array of size $n$ where $ans[i]$ is the number of nodes in the subtree of the $i$-th node which have the same label as node $i$.

A subtree of a tree $T$ is the tree consisting of a node in $T$ and all of its descendant nodes.

class Solution {
    void dfs(int u, int p, vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<vector<int>> &cnt)
    {
        for (int v : adj[u])
        {
            // avoid traveling back
            if (v == p)
                continue;
            
            // dfs, processing subtrees.
            dfs(v, u, adj, cnt);
            
            // collect results from subtrees.
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
                cnt[u][i] += cnt[v][i];
        }
    }

    vector<int> countSubTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, string labels) {
        vector<int> ans(n);
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        vector<vector<int>> cnt(n, vector<int>(26));
        
        for (auto &e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ++ cnt[i][labels[i] - 'a'];
        
        dfs(0, -1, adj, cnt);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ans[i] = cnt[i][labels[i] - 'a'];
