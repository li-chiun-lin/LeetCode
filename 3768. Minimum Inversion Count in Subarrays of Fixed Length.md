# Hard

You are given an integer array $nums$ of length $n$ and an integer $k$.

An inversion is a pair of indices $(i, j)$ from $nums$ such that $i < j$ and $nums[i] > nums[j]$.

The inversion count of a subarray is the number of inversions within it.

Return the minimum inversion count among all subarrays of $nums$ with length $k$.
