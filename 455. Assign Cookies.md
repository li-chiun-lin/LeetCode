# Easy

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child $i$ has a greed factor $g[i]$, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie $j$ has a size $s[j]$. If $s[j] >= g[i]$, we can assign the cookie $j$ to the child $i$, and the child $i$ will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        int i = 0; 
        int j = 0;
        int n = g.size();
        int m = s.size();
        
        sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        
        while (i < n && j < m)
        {
            if (s[j] >= g[i])
                ++ i;
            
            ++ j;
        }
        
        return i;
    }
};
```
