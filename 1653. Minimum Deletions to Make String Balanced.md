# Medium

You are given a string $s$ consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in $s$ to make $s$ balanced. $s$ is balanced if there is no pair of indices $(i,j)$ such that $i < j$ and $s[i] =$ 'b' and $s[j] =$ 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make $s$ balanced.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(string s) {
        int n = size(s);
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        int cnt = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (s[i] == 'a')
                dp[i + 1] = min(dp[i] + 1, cnt);
            else
            {
                dp[i + 1] = dp[i];
                ++ cnt;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
