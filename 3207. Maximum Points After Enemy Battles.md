# Medium

You are given an integer array $enemyEnergies$ denoting the energy values of various enemies.

You are also given an integer $currentEnergy$ denoting the amount of energy you have initially.

You start with 0 points, and all the enemies are unmarked initially.

You can perform either of the following operations zero or multiple times to gain points:

- Choose an unmarked enemy, $i$, such that $currentEnergy \geq enemyEnergies[i]$. By choosing this option:
  - You gain 1 point.
  - Your energy is reduced by the enemy's energy.
- If you have at least 1 point, you can choose an unmarked enemy, $i$. By choosing this option:
  - Your energy increases by the enemy's energy.
  - The enemy $i$ is marked.

Return an integer denoting the maximum points you can get in the end by optimally performing operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumPoints(vector<int>& enemyEnergies, int currentEnergy) {
        sort(begin(enemyEnergies), end(enemyEnergies));
        long long ans = 0;
        
        while (size(enemyEnergies) && currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[0])
        {
            ans += currentEnergy / enemyEnergies[0];
            currentEnergy %= enemyEnergies[0];
            
            currentEnergy += enemyEnergies.back();
            enemyEnergies.pop_back();
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
