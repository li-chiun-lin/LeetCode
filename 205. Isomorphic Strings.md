# Easy

Given two strings $s$ and $t$, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings $s$ and $t$ are isomorphic if the characters in $s$ can be replaced to get $t$.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> s2t(256, -1);
        vector<int> t2s(256, -1);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (s2t[s[i]] != -1 && s2t[s[i]] != t[i])
                return false;
            
            s2t[s[i]] = t[i];
            
            if (t2s[t[i]] != -1 && t2s[t[i]] != s[i])
                return false;
            
            t2s[t[i]] = s[i];
        }
         
        return true;
    }
};
```
