# Easy

You are given an array $nums$ of non-negative integers. $nums$ is considered special if there exists a number $x$ such that there are exactly $x$ numbers in $nums$ that are greater than or equal to $x$.

Notice that $x$ does not have to be an element in $nums$.

Return $x$ if the array is special, otherwise, return $-1$. It can be proven that if $nums$ is special, the value for $x$ is unique.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int specialArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        map<int, int> hit;
        int acc = 0;
        
        for (int x : nums)
            ++hit[x];
        
        int bound = hit.rbegin()->first;
        
        while (bound)
        {
            acc += hit[bound];
            
            if (acc == bound)
                return bound;
            
            -- bound;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```
