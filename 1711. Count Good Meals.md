A good meal is a meal that contains exactly two different food items with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick any two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers $deliciousness$ where $deliciousness[i]$ is the deliciousness of the $i$-​​​​​​th​​​​​​​​ item of food, return the number of different good meals you can make from this list modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(vector<int>& deliciousness) {
        map<int, int> mp;
        long long ans = 0;
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        int ub = 1 << 22;

        for (auto d : deliciousness)
        {
            for (int b = 1 << 21; b ; b >>= 1)
                if (mp.count(b - d))
                    ans += mp[b - d];

            ++ mp[d];
        }

        return ans % m;
    }
};
```
