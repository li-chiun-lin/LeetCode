We build a table of $n$ rows (1-indexed). We start by writing $0$ in the $1$-st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of $0$ with $01$, and each occurrence of $1$ with $10$.

Given two integer $n$ and $k$, return the $k$-th (1-indexed) symbol in the $n$-th row of a table of $n$ rows.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(int N, int K, long half) {
        if (N == 1)
            return 0;

        if (K <= half)
            return dfs(N - 1, K, half / 2);
        else
            return 1 - dfs(N - 1, K - half, half / 2);
    }
    
public:
    int kthGrammar(int N, int K){
        return dfs(N, K, pow(2, N - 2));
    }
};
```
