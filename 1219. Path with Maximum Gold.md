# Medium

In a gold mine $grid$ of size $m \times n$, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, $0$ if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

- Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
- From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
- You can't visit the same cell more than once.
- Never visit a cell with $0$ gold.
- You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int d[5] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int acc, int &ret)
    {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        if (i < 0 || m <= i || j < 0 || n <= j || grid[i][j] == 0)
        {
            ret = max(ret, acc);
            return ;
        }

        grid[i][j] = 0;
        acc += v;
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k)
            dfs(grid, i + d[k], j + d[k + 1], acc, ret);
        
        grid[i][j] = v;
    }
