# Easy

There is a hidden integer array $arr$ that consists of $n$ non-negative integers.

It was encoded into another integer array $encoded$ of length $n - 1$, such that $encoded[i] = arr[i] \oplus arr[i + 1]$.

You are given the $encoded$ array. You are also given an integer $first$, that is the first element of $arr$, i.e. $arr[0]$.

Return the original array $arr$. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> decode(vector<int>& encoded, int first) {
        encoded[0] ^= first;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < encoded.size(); ++i)
            encoded[i] ^= encoded[i - 1];
        
        encoded.insert(encoded.begin(), first);
        
        return encoded;
    }
};
```
