# Medium

You have a 2-D $grid$ of size $m \times n$ representing a box, and you have $n$ balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.

- A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as $1$.
- A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as $-1$.

We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return an array $answer$ of size $n$ where $answer[i]$ is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the $i$-th column at the top, or $-1$ if the ball gets stuck in the box.
