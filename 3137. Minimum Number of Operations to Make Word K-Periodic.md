# Medium

You are given a string $word$ of size $n$, and an integer $k$ such that $k$ divides $n$.

In one operation, you can pick any two indices $i$ and $j$, that are divisible by $k$, then replace the substring of length $k$ starting at $i$ with the substring of length $k$ starting at $j$. That is, replace the substring $word[i..i + k - 1]$ with the substring $word[j..j + k - 1]$.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make word $k$-periodic.

We say that word is $k$-periodic if there is some string $s$ of length $k$ such that word can be obtained by concatenating $s$ an arbitrary number of times.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperationsToMakeKPeriodic(string word, int k) {
        int n = size(word);
        map<string, int> cnt;
        int ma = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k)
            ++ cnt[word.substr(i, k)];
        
        for (auto& [s, c] : cnt)
            ma = max(ma, c);
        
        return n / k - ma;
    }
};
```
