You are given an integer array $nums$. You need to create a 2D array from $nums$ satisfying the following conditions:

- The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array $nums$.
- Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
- The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.

Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Note that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findMatrix(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret(1);
        int group = 0;
        
        // sort it, so that duplicated elements will be put next to each other.
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));

        // the first element surely should be put into the first group.
        ret[group ++].push_back(nums[0]);
        
        // iterate from the second element, 
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i)
        {
            // if this is a new/non-duplicated element,
            // we can go back to grou 0.
            if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1])
                group = 0;
            // if this is a duplicate element, 
            // check if we have to extend a new group for it.
            else if (ret.size() <= group)
                ret.push_back({});
                
            // put this element in to the right group
            ret[group ++].push_back(nums[i]);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
