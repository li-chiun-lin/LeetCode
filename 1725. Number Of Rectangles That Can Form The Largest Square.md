# Easy

You are given an array $rectangles$ where $rectangles[i] = [l_i, w_i]$ represents the $i$-th rectangle of length $l_i$ and width $w_i$.

You can cut the $i$-th rectangle to form a square with a side length of $k$ if both $k <= l_i$ and $k <= w_i$.

Let $maxLen$ be the side length of the largest square you can obtain from any of the given rectangles.

Return the number of rectangles that can make a square with a side length of $maxLen$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles) {
        map<int, int> hist;
        int m = 0;
        
        for (auto &v : rectangles)
        {
            int kk = min(v[0], v[1]);
            ++ hist[kk];
            m = max(m, kk);
        }
        
        return hist[m];
    }
};
```
