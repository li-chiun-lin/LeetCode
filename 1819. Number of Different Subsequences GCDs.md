# Hard

You are given an array $nums$ that consists of positive integers.

The GCD of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence evenly.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

Return the number of different GCDs among all non-empty subsequences of $nums$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDifferentSubsequenceGCDs(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> fac(200001);

        for (int x : nums)
            for (int y = 1; y * y <= x; ++y)
                if (x % y == 0)
                {
                    int f1 = y;
                    int f2 = x / y;
                    fac[f1] = __gcd(fac[f1], x);
                    fac[f2] = __gcd(fac[f2], x);
                }

        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < size(fac); ++i)
            if (fac[i] == i)
                ++ ans;

        return ans;
    }
};
```
