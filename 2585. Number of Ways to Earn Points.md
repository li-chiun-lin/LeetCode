# Hard

There is a test that has $n$ types of questions. You are given an integer $target$ and a 0-indexed 2D integer array $types$ where $types[i] = [count_i, marks_i]$ indicates that there are $count_i$ questions of the $i$-th type, and each one of them is worth $marks_i$ points.

Return the number of ways you can earn exactly $target$ points in the exam. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

Note that questions of the same type are indistinguishable.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int waysToReachTarget(int target, vector<vector<int>>& types) {
        vector<int> dp(target + 1);
        dp[0] = 1;
        int m = 1e9 + 7;

        for (auto& t : types)
        {
            for (int i = target; i > 0; --i)
            {
                for (int k = 1; k <= t[0] && i - t[1] * k >= 0; ++k)
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - t[1] * k]) % m;
            }
        }

        return dp[target];
    }
};
```
