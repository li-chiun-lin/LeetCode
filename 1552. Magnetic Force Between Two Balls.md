In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the $i$-th basket is at $position[i]$, Morty has $m$ balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions $x$ and $y$ is $|x - y|$.

Given the integer array $position$ and the integer m. Return the required force.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
        auto count = [&](int d)
        {
            int ans = 0;
            int cur = -d;

            for (int p : position)
                if (p - cur >= d)
                {
                    ++ ans;
                    cur = p;
                }

            return ans;
        };

        sort(begin(position), end(position));
        int l = 0, r = position.back() - position.front();

        while (l < r)
        {
            int mid = r - (r - l) / 2;

            if (count(mid) >= m)
                l = mid;
            else
                r = mid - 1;
        }

        return l;
    }
};
```
