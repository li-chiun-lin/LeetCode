# Easy

You are given a string $text$ of words that are placed among some number of spaces. Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated by at least one space. It's guaranteed that $text$ contains at least one word.

Rearrange the spaces so that there is an equal number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is maximized. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the extra spaces at the end, meaning the returned string should be the same length as $text$.

Return the string after rearranging the spaces.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reorderSpaces(string text) {
        stringstream ss(text);
        string tok = "";
        vector<string> w;
        
        // count the number of spaces.
        int c = count(text.begin(), text.end(), ' ');
        
        // count the number of words.
        while (ss >> tok)
            w.push_back(tok);
        
        // special case when there is only one word in text.
        if (w.size() == 1)
            return w[0] + string(c, ' ');
        
        // how many spaces should be put between any two words.
        int span = c / (w.size() - 1);
        string inter(span, ' ');
        // the rest of the spaces should be put at the end.
        c %= (w.size() - 1);
        
        string ret = w[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < w.size(); ++i)
            ret += inter + w[i];
        
        return ret + string(c, ' ');
    }
};
```
