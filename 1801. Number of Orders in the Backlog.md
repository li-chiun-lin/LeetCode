You are given a 2D integer array **orders**, where each **orders[i] = [price<sub>i</sub>, amount<sub>i</sub>, orderType<sub>i</sub>]** denotes that **amount<sub>i</sub>** orders have been placed of type **orderType<sub>i</sub>** at the price **price<sub>i</sub>**. The orderTypei is:

- **0** if it is a batch of **buy** orders, or
- **1** if it is a batch of **sell** orders.

Note that **orders[i]** represents a batch of **amount<sub>i</sub>** independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by **orders[i]** will be placed before all orders represented by **orders[i+1]** for all valid **i**.

There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:

- If the order is a **buy** order, you look at the **sell** order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that **sell** order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that **sell** order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the **buy** order is added to the backlog.
- Vice versa, if the order is a **sell** order, you look at the **buy** order with the largest price in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal to the current **sell** order's price, they will match and be executed, and that **buy** order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the **sell** order is added to the backlog.

Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo **10<sup>9</sup> + 7**.
