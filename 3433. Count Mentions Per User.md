You are given an integer $numberOfUsers$ representing the total number of users and an array $events$ of size $n \times 3$.

Each $events[i]$ can be either of the following two types:

1. Message Event: ["MESSAGE", "$timestamp_i$", "$mentions_string_i$"]
    - This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at $timestamp_i$.
    - The $mentions_string_i$ string can contain one of the following tokens:
        - id<$number$>: where <$number$> is an integer in range $[0,numberOfUsers - 1]$. There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
        - ALL: mentions all users.
        - HERE: mentions all online users.
1. Offline Event: ["OFFLINE", "$timestamp_i$", "$id_i$"]
        This event indicates that the user $id_i$ had become offline at $timestamp_i$ for $60$ time units. The user will automatically be online again at time $timestamp_i + 60$.

Return an array $mentions$ where $mentions[i]$ represents the number of mentions the user with id $i$ has across all MESSAGE events.

All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed before handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.

Note that a user can be mentioned multiple times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted separately.
