# Easy

A bus has $n$ stops numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$ that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where $distance[i]$ is the distance between the stops number $i$ and $(i + 1) \mod n$.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given $start$ and $destination$ stops.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distanceBetweenBusStops(vector<int>& distance, int start, int destination) {
        int sum = accumulate(begin(distance), end(distance), 0);
        int half = 0;
        int s = min(start, destination);
        int e = max(start, destination);
        
        while (s != e)
            half += distance[s ++];
        
        return min(half, sum - half);
    }
};
```
