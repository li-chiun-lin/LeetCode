A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with $n$ vertices where each vertex is labeled from $1$ to $n$ (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array $edges$, where each $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex $u_i$ and vertex $v_i$. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is $time$ minutes.

Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every $change$ minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.

The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.

Given $n, edges, time,$ and $change$, return the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex $1$ to vertex $n$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int secondMinimum(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int time, int change) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);
        vector<int> dst(n + 1, 10001);

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        auto convert = [&](int s)
        {
            int r = 0;

            while (-- s)
            {
                r += time;

                if ((r / change) % 2)
                    r = (r / change + 1) * change;
            }

            return r + time;
        };

        int step = -1;
        int s = 0;
        queue<int> que;

        que.push(1);

        while ((s = size(que)) && ++ step <= dst[n] + 1)
        {
            while (s --)
            {
                int u = que.front();
                que.pop();

                if (step == dst[u] || step > dst[u] + 1)
                    continue;

                dst[u] = min(dst[u], step);

                if (u == n && step > dst[n])
                    return convert(step);

                for (int v : adj[u])
                    que.push(v);
            }
        }

        return convert(dst[n] + 2);
