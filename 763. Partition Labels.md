You are given a string $s$. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be $s$.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> partitionLabels(string s) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> segments; // Stores the first and last occurrence of each character
        unordered_set<char> visited; // Tracks visited characters
        vector<int> result; // Stores the partition sizes
        
        // Identify segments for each unique character
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (visited.count(s[i])) // Skip if character is already processed
                continue;
            
            visited.insert(s[i]);
            for (int j = s.size() - 1; j >= i; --j) {
                if (s[j] == s[i]) { // Find last occurrence of character
                    segments.push_back({i, j});
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Merge overlapping segments to determine partitions
        int left = segments[0].first;
        int right = segments[0].second;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < segments.size(); ++i) {
            if (right < segments[i].first) { // Non-overlapping segment, finalize the previous partition
                result.push_back(right - left + 1);
                left = segments[i].first;
                right = segments[i].second;
            } else { // Merge overlapping segments
                right = max(right, segments[i].second);
            }
        }
        
        result.push_back(right - left + 1); // Add last partition size
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
