It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.

At the store, there are **n** ice cream bars. You are given an array **costs** of length **n**, where **costs[i]** is the price of the **i**-th ice cream bar in coins. The boy initially has **coins** coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible.

Return the maximum number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with **coins** coins.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxIceCream(vector<int>& costs, int coins) {
        int n = costs.size();
        sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (coins >= costs[i])
                coins -= costs[i];
            else
                return i;
        }
        
        return costs.size();
    }
};
```
