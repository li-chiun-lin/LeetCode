# Easy

Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly $duration$ seconds. More formally, an attack at second $t$ will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval $[t, t + duration - 1]$. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end $duration$ seconds after the new attack.

You are given a non-decreasing integer array $timeSeries$, where $timeSeries[i]$ denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second $timeSeries[i]$, and an integer $duration$.

Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPoisonedDuration(vector<int>& timeSeries, int duration) {
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < timeSeries.size() - 1; ++i)
        {
            if (timeSeries[i] + duration <= timeSeries[i + 1])
                sum += duration;
            else
                sum += timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i];
        }
        
        return sum + duration;
    }
};
```
