# Easy

An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list $[x1, y1, x2, y2]$, where $(x1, y1)$ is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and $(x2, y2)$ is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two axis-aligned rectangles $rec1$ and $rec2$, return $true$ if they overlap, otherwise return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isRectangleOverlap(vector<int>& rec1, vector<int>& rec2) {
        int x1 = rec1[0];
        int y1 = rec1[1];
        int x2 = rec1[2];
        int y2 = rec1[3];
        
        int x3 = rec2[0];
        int y3 = rec2[1];
        int x4 = rec2[2];
        int y4 = rec2[3];
        
        return  (x2 > x3 && x4 > x1)
            &&  (y2 > y3 && y4 > y1);
    }
};
```
