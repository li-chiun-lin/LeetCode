You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```cpp
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to $NULL$.

Initially, all next pointers are set to $NULL$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        queue<Node*> que;
        int s = 0;
        Node *nxt = NULL;
        Node *cur = NULL;
        
        if (root)
            que.push(root);
        
        while (s = que.size())
        {
            nxt = NULL;
            
            while (--s >= 0)
            {
                cur = que.front();
                que.pop();
                
                cur->next = nxt;
                nxt = cur;
                
                if (cur->right)
                    que.push(cur->right);
                
                if (cur->left)
                    que.push(cur->left);
            }
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};
```
