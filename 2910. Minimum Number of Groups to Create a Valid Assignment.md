# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ of length $n$.

We want to group the indices so for each index $i$ in the range $[0, n - 1]$, it is assigned to exactly one group.

A group assignment is valid if the following conditions hold:

- For every group $g$, all indices $i$ assigned to group $g$ have the same value in $nums$.
- For any two groups $g_1$ and $g_2$, the difference between the number of indices assigned to $g_1$ and $g_2$ should not exceed $1$.

Return an integer denoting the minimum number of groups needed to create a valid group assignment.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minGroupsForValidAssignment(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> hist;
        vector<int> grp;
        
        for (auto x : nums)
            ++ hist[x];
        
        for (auto& [k, v] : hist)
            grp.push_back(v);
        
        int ans = size(nums);
        int lb = *min_element(begin(grp), end(grp));
        
        for (int x = 1; x <= lb; ++x)
        {
            int g = 0;
            
            for (int f : grp)
            {
                int a = f / (x + 1);
                int b = f % (x + 1);

                if (b == 0)
                    g += a;
                else if (x - b <= a)
                    g += a + 1;
                else
                {
                    g = INT_MAX;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            ans = min(ans, g);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
