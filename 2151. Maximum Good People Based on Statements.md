# Hard

There are two types of persons:

- The good person: The person who always tells the truth.
- The bad person: The person who might tell the truth and might lie.

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array **statements** of size **n x n** that represents the statements made by **n** people about each other. More specifically, **statements[i][j]** could be one of the following:

- **0** which represents a statement made by person **i** that person **j** is a bad person.
- **1** which represents a statement made by person **i** that person **j** is a good person.
- **2** represents that no statement is made by person **i** about person **j**.

Additionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. Formally, we have that **statements[i][i] = 2** for all **0 <= i < n**.

Return the **maximum** number of people who can be good based on the statements made by the n people.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumGood(vector<vector<int>>& statements) {
        int n = statements.size();
        int b = 1 << n;
        int r = 0;
        
        // k is a bitset of size n, 
        // every person is presented by a bit, 1 means the person is presumed good, 0 otherwise.
        // for every possible combination, 
        for (int k = 0; k < b; ++k)
        {
            bool stillGood = true;
            int c = 0;
            
            // for every person i, 
            for(int i = 0; i < n && stillGood; ++i)
            {
                // if the person i is not presumed good, skip.
                if (((k >> i) & 1) == 0)
                    continue;
                
                //in combination k, i is presume good, 
                // count good i.
                ++ c;

                // check the statement of i to j, and the presume state of j.
                for (int j = 0; j < n && stillGood; ++j)
                {
                    if (statements[i][j] == 2)
                        continue;

                    stillGood = statements[i][j] == ((k >> j) & 1);
                }
            }
            
            if (stillGood)
                r = max(r, c);;
        }
        
        return r;
    }
};
```
