You are given two positive integers $n$ and $k$. A factor of an integer $n$ is defined as an integer $i$ where $n % i == 0$.

Consider a list of all factors of $n$ sorted in ascending order, return the $k$-th factor in this list or return $-1$ if $n$ has less than $k$ factors.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            if (n % i == 0)
                if (-- k == 0)
                    return i;
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```
