# Medium

You are given an integer array $nums$. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any $nums[i]$ and delete it to earn $nums[i]$ points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to $nums[i] - 1$ and every element equal to $nums[i] + 1$.

Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> hist;
        
        for (int x : nums)
            ++ hist[x];
        
        int pre = -1;
        int val = 0;
        int dp0 = 0;
        int dp1 = 0;
        int dp2 = dp1;
        
        for (auto& h : hist)
        {
            val = h.first * h.second;
            
            if (h.first > pre + 1)
                dp2 = dp1 + val;
            else
                dp2 = max(dp0 + val, dp1);
            
            dp0 = dp1;
            dp1 = dp2;
            pre = h.first;
        }
        
        return dp2;
    }
};
```
