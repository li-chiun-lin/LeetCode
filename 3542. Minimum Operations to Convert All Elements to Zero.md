You are given an array $nums$ of size $n$, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to apply some (possibly zero) operations on the array so that all elements become $0$.

In one operation, you can select a subarray $[i, j]$ (where $0 \leq i \leq j < n)$ and set all occurrences of the minimum non-negative integer in that subarray to $0$.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        stack<int> mono_stack; // Maintains a non-decreasing stack
        int operations = 0;

        mono_stack.push(0); // Sentinel value to simplify comparison

        for (int x : nums) {
            // Remove all elements greater than x to maintain increasing order
            while (!mono_stack.empty() && mono_stack.top() > x)
                mono_stack.pop();

            // If x is strictly greater than the top (new increasing step)
            if (mono_stack.empty() || mono_stack.top() < x) {
                ++operations;
                mono_stack.push(x);
            }
            // If x == top, it's a duplicate of the last value, no operation needed
        }

        return operations;
    }
};
```
