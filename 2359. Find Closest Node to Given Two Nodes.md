You are given a directed graph of $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array $edges$ of size $n$, indicating that there is a directed edge from node $i$ to node $edges[i]$. If there is no outgoing edge from $i$, then $edges[i] == -1$.

You are also given two integers $node1$ and $node2$.

Return the index of the node that can be reached from both $node1$ and $node2$, such that the maximum between the distance from $node1$ to that node, and from $node2$ to that node is minimized. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the smallest index, and if no possible answer exists, return $-1$.

Note that $edges$ may contain cycles.

    void bfs(vector<int>& edges, int node, vector<int>& dst)
    {
        int limit = 1e9 + 7;
        queue<int> que;
        que.push(node);
        
        int s = 0;
        int c = 0;
        
        while (s = que.size())
        {
            while (s --)
            {
                int u = que.front();
                que.pop();
