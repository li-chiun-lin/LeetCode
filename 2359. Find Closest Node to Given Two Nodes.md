You are given a directed graph of $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array $edges$ of size $n$, indicating that there is a directed edge from node $i$ to node $edges[i]$. If there is no outgoing edge from $i$, then $edges[i] == -1$.

You are also given two integers $node1$ and $node2$.

Return the index of the node that can be reached from both $node1$ and $node2$, such that the maximum between the distance from $node1$ to that node, and from $node2$ to that node is minimized. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the smallest index, and if no possible answer exists, return $-1$.

Note that $edges$ may contain cycles.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int closestMeetingNode(vector<int>& edges, int node1, int node2) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<int> distFromNode1(n, -1);  // Distance from node1 to every other node
        vector<int> distFromNode2(n, -1);  // Distance from node2 to every other node

        // Traverse from node1 and record distances
        for (int current = node1, distance = 0; 
             current != -1 && distFromNode1[current] == -1; 
             current = edges[current], ++distance) 
        {
            distFromNode1[current] = distance;
        }

        // Traverse from node2 and record distances
        for (int current = node2, distance = 0; 
             current != -1 && distFromNode2[current] == -1; 
             current = edges[current], ++distance) 
        {
            distFromNode2[current] = distance;
        }

        int minMaxDistance = INT_MAX;
        int resultIndex = -1;

        // Find the node reachable from both node1 and node2 with minimal maximum distance
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (distFromNode1[i] != -1 && distFromNode2[i] != -1) {
                int maxDistance = max(distFromNode1[i], distFromNode2[i]);
                if (maxDistance < minMaxDistance) {
                    minMaxDistance = maxDistance;
                    resultIndex = i;
                }
            }
        }

        return resultIndex;
    }
};
