# Medium

You are given a positive integer $days$ representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array $meetings$ of size $n$ where, $meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]$ represents the starting and ending days of meeting $i$ (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    int countDays(int days, vector<vector<int>>& meetings) 
    {
        map<int, int> mergedMeetings;

        // Merge overlapping meetings while keeping track of the latest end time for each start time
        for (auto& meeting : meetings) 
        {
            mergedMeetings[meeting[0]] = max(mergedMeetings[meeting[0]], meeting[1]);
        }

        int busyDays = 0; // Count of days occupied by meetings
        int lastEnd = 0;  // Tracks the last merged meeting end time

        // Iterate through the sorted meeting intervals
        for (auto [start, end] : mergedMeetings) 
        {
            if (lastEnd < start) 
            {
                // If there's a gap, count all days from start to end
                busyDays += end - start + 1;
                lastEnd = end;
            } 
            else if (lastEnd < end) 
            {
                // If overlapping, count only the additional days beyond lastEnd
                busyDays += end - lastEnd;
                lastEnd = end;
            }
        }

        // The number of free days is total days minus busy days
        return days - busyDays;
    }
};
