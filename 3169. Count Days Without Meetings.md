# Medium

You are given a positive integer $days$ representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array $meetings$ of size $n$ where, $meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]$ represents the starting and ending days of meeting $i$ (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDays(int days, vector<vector<int>>& meetings) {
        map<int, int> mp;

        for (auto& m : meetings)
            mp[m[0]] = max(mp[m[0]], m[1]);

        int cnt = 0;
        int end = 0;

        for (auto [s, e] : mp)
        {
            if (end < s)
            {
                cnt += e - s + 1;
                end = e;
            }
            else if (end < e)
            {
                cnt += e - end;
                end = e;
            }
        }

        return days - cnt;
    }
};
```
