A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.

A sentence is circular if:

- The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
- The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.

Given a string $sentence$, return $true$ if it is circular. Otherwise, return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCircularSentence(string sentence) {
        sentence += ' ';
        sentence += sentence[0];
        
        stringstream ss(sentence);
        string tok;
        char tail = 0;
        
        ss >> tok;
        tail = tok.back();
        
        while (ss >> tok)
        {
            if (tail != tok[0])
                return false;
            
            tail = tok.back();
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
