You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have conflicts. A conflict exists if a younger player has a strictly higher score than an older player. A conflict does not occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, $scores$ and $ages$, where each $scores[i]$ and $ages[i]$ represents the score and age of the $i$-th player, respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bestTeamScore(vector<int>& scores, vector<int>& ages) {
        int n = scores.size();
        vector<pair<int, int>> p(n);
        vector<int> dp(n);
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            p[i] = {ages[i], scores[i]};
        
        // sorted by ages ascendingly
        sort(begin(p), end(p));
        
        // for each player i after sorting, 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            dp[i] = p[i].second;
            
            // for each player j that are younger or at the same age as player i, 
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j)
                // if the score of player j is samller or equal to that of player i, 
                // there won't be any conflict, hence we can safely include player j inside the team with player i.
                // then we find the maximum possible score of the team which player i belongs to.
                if (p[i].second >= p[j].second)
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + p[i].second);
            
            ret = max(ret, dp[i]);
        }
    
        return ret;
    }
};
```
