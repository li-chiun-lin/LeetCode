# Easy

You are given an integer $n$. Your task is to compute the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two values:

- $sumOdd$: the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers.
- $sumEven$: the sum of the first $n$ even numbers.

Return the GCD of $sumOdd$ and $sumEven$.

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    int gcdOfOddEvenSums(int n)
    {
        // sum of first n odd numbers = n^2
        int sumOfOdds = n * n;

        // sum of first n even numbers = n * (n + 1)
        int sumOfEvens = n * (n + 1);

        // return gcd of both sums
        return gcd(sumOfOdds, sumOfEvens);
    }
};
```
