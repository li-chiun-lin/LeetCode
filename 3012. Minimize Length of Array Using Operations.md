You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ containing positive integers.

Your task is to minimize the length of $nums$ by performing the following operations any number of times (including zero):

- Select two distinct indices $i$ and $j$ from nums, such that $nums[i] > 0$ and $nums[j] > 0$.
- Insert the result of $nums[i] \mod nums[j]$ at the end of $nums$.
- Delete the elements at indices $i$ and $j$ from $nums$.

Return an integer denoting the minimum length of $nums$ after performing the operation any number of times.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumArrayLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = size(nums);
        map<int, int> hist;
        
        for (auto x : nums)
            ++ hist[x];
        
        auto [lb, cnt] = *begin(hist);

        // case 1
        if (cnt == 1)
            return 1;

        // case 2
        for (auto it = next(begin(hist)); it != end(hist); ++it)
            if (it->first % lb)
                return 1;

        // case 3
        return (cnt + 1) / 2;
    }
};
```
