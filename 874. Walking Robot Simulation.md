# Medium

A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point $(0, 0)$ facing north. The robot can receive a sequence of these three possible types of commands:

- $-2$: Turn left $90$ degrees.
- $-1$: Turn right $90$ degrees.
- $1 \leq k \leq 9$: Move forward $k$ units, one unit at a time.

Some of the grid squares are $obstacles$. The $i$-th obstacle is at grid point $obstacles[i] = (x_i, y_i)$. If the robot runs into an obstacle, then it will instead stay in its current location and move on to the next command.

Return the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot ever gets from the origin squared.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int robotSim(vector<int>& commands, vector<vector<int>>& obstacles) {
        int dir[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        int d = 0;
        int m = 0;
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        
        map<pair<int, int>, bool> obs;
        for (auto o : obstacles)
            obs[{o[0], o[1]}] = true;
        
        for (int c : commands)
        {
            if (c == -2)
                d = (d + 3) % 4;
            else if (c == -1)
                d = (d + 1) % 4;
            else
            {
                while (-- c >= 0)
                {
                    if (obs[{x + dir[d], y + dir[d + 1]}])
                        break;
                    
                    x += dir[d];
                    y += dir[d + 1];
                }
                
                m = max(m, x * x + y * y);
            }
        }
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
