# Easy

You are given a string *word* that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.

You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, **"a123bc34d8ef34"** will become **" 123  34 8  34"**. Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: **"123", "34", "8"**, and **"34"**.

Return the number of **different** integers after performing the replacement operations on *word*.

Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numDifferentIntegers(string word) {
        // with the constraint that 1 <= word.length <= 1000, 
        // it's not an option to use set<int> or set<long long>.
        set<string> hit;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); ++i)
            if (! isdigit(word[i]))
                word[i] = ' ';
        
        // I use the stringstream to handle the string-separation.
        stringstream ss(word);
        string tok;
        
        while (ss >> tok)
        {
            // the leading 0's handling is the only ugly part...
            if (tok[0] == '0')
            {
                reverse(tok.begin(), tok.end());
                
                while (tok.size() && tok.back() =='0')
                    tok.pop_back();
                
                if (tok.size())
                {
                    reverse(tok.begin(), tok.end());
                    hit.insert(tok);
                }
                else // be carefull with the corner case that the whole tok is consisting of 0's.
                    hit.insert("0");
            }
            else
                hit.insert(tok);
        }
        
        return hit.size();
    }
};
```
