# Medium

Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array **bank** representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an **m x n** 2D matrix. **bank[i]** represents the **i**-th row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while '1' means the cell has a security device.

There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:

- The two devices are located on two different rows: **r1** and **r2**, where **r1 < r2**.
- For each row **i** where **r1 < i < r2**, there are no security devices in the **i**-th row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfBeams(vector<string>& bank) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        
        vector<int> beam(bank.size());
        
        for (int b = 0; b < bank.size(); ++b)
            for (char c : bank[b])
                beam[b] += c - '0';
        
        int pre = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < beam.size(); ++i)
        {
            if (beam[i] == 0)
                continue;
            
            if (pre != -1)
                cnt += pre * beam[i];
            
            pre = beam[i];
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
