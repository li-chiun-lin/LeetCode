Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

- Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
- Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, $word1$ and $word2$, return $true$ if $word1$ and $word2$ are close, and $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool closeStrings(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<int> h1(26), h2(26);
        int s1 = 0, s2 = 0;
        
        for (char c : word1)
        {
            ++h1[c - 'a'];
            s1 |= 1 << (c - 'a');
        }
        
        for (char c : word2)
        {
            ++h2[c - 'a'];
            s2 |= 1 << (c - 'a');
        }
        
        sort(begin(h1), end(h1));
        sort(begin(h2), end(h2));
        
        return h1 == h2 && s1 == s2;
    }
};
```
