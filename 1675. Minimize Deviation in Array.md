# Hard

You are given an array $nums$ of $n$ positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

- If the element is even, divide it by $2$.
- If the element is odd, multiply it by $2$.

The deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeviation(vector<int>& nums) {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        int m = INT_MAX;
        int r = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int x : nums)
        {
            if (x % 2)
                x *= 2;
            
            m = min(m, x);
            
            pq.push(x);
        }
        
        r = min(r, pq.top() - m);
        
        while (pq.size() && pq.top() % 2 == 0)
        {
            int t = pq.top() / 2;
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(t);
            
            m = min(m, t);
            r = min(r, pq.top() - m);
        }
        
        return r;
    }
};
```
