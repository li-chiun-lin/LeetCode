# Hard

You are given two strings, $word1$ and $word2$. You want to construct a string in the following manner:

- Choose some non-empty subsequence $subsequence1$ from $word1$.
- Choose some non-empty subsequence $subsequence2$ from $word2$.
- Concatenate the subsequences: $subsequence1 + subsequence2$, to make the string.

Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed in the described manner. If no palindromes can be constructed, return $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string word1, string word2) {
        int n = size(word1) + size(word2);
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n));
        string w = word1 + word2;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            dp[i][i] = 1;

            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j)
                dp[i][j] = w[i] == w[j]
                    ? dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2
                    : max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < size(word1); ++i)
            for (int j = size(word2) - 1; j >= 0; --j)
                if (word1[i] == word2[j])
                {
                    ans = max(ans, dp[i + 1][size(word1) + j - 1] + 2);
                    break;
                }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
