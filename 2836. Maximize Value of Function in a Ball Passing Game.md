# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $receiver$ of length $n$ and an integer $k$.

There are $n$ players having a unique id in the range $[0, n - 1]$ who will play a ball passing game, and $receiver[i]$ is the id of the player who receives passes from the player with id $i$. Players can pass to themselves.

You must choose one of the $n$ players as the starting player for the game, and the ball will be passed exactly $k$ times starting from the chosen player.

For a chosen starting player having id $x$, we define a function $f(x)$ that denotes the sum of $x$ and the ids of all players who receive the ball during the $k$ passes, including repetitions. In other words, $f(x) = x + receiver[x] + receiver[receiver[x]] + ... + receiver(k) [x]$.

Your task is to choose a starting player having id $x$ that maximizes the value of $f(x)$.

Return an integer denoting the maximum value of the function.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long getMaxFunctionValue(vector<int>& receiver, long long k) {
        int m = 8 * sizeof(k) - __builtin_clzll(k);
        int n = receiver.size();
        vector<vector<pair<int, long long>>> dp(m, vector<pair<int, long long>>(n));

        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            dp[0][j] = {receiver[j], receiver[j]};

        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            {
                auto [f, s] = dp[i - 1][j];
                dp[i][j] = {dp[i - 1][f].first, s + dp[i - 1][f].second};
            }

        function<long long(int, long long)> fun = [&](int now, long long p) -> long long
        {
            if (p == -1)
                return 0;

            if ((k & (1LL << p)) == 0)
                return fun(now, p - 1);

            return dp[p][now].second + fun(dp[p][now].first, p - 1);
        };

        long long ret = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ret = max(ret, fun(i, m - 1) + i);

        return ret;
    }
