The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers $x$ and $y$, return the Hamming distance between them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int c = 0;
        int t = x ^ y;
        
        while (t)
        {
            c += t & 1;
            t >>= 1;
        }
        
        return c;
    }
};
```
