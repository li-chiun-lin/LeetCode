# Easy

You are given two 0-indexed strings $s$ and $target$. You can take some letters from $s$ and rearrange them to form new strings.

Return the maximum number of copies of $target$ that can be formed by taking letters from s and rearranging them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rearrangeCharacters(string s, string target) {
        map<char, int> tar;
        map<char, int> sss;
        
        for (char c : target)
            ++ tar[c];
        
        for (char c : s)
            ++ sss[c];
        
        int ret = INT_MAX;
        
        for (auto &h : tar)
            ret = min(ret, sss[h.first] / h.second);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
