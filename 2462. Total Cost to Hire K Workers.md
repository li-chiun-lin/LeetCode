# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $costs$ where $costs[i]$ is the cost of hiring the $i$-th worker.

You are also given two integers $k$ and $candidates$. We want to hire exactly $k$ workers according to the following rules:

- You will run $k$ sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
- In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first $candidates$ workers or the last $candidates$ workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
- If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
- A worker can only be chosen once.

Return the total cost to hire exactly $k$ workers.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long totalCost(vector<int>& costs, int k, int candidates) {
        int n = costs.size();
        long long ret = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = n - 1;
        
        // two min-heap, 
        // one for the first `candidates'
        // the other for the last `candidates'
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<>> pq1, pq2;
        
        // the first `candidates'
        for (int i = 0; i < candidates && l <= r; ++i)
            pq1.push(costs[l ++]);
        
        // the last `candidates', there might be overlap, so we add another constrain.
        for (int i = 0; i < candidates && l <= r; ++i)
            pq2.push(costs[r --]);
        
        // k sessions
        while (k --)
        {
            // under the following circumstances, 
            // we pick the one with lowest cost from the second min-heap.
            if (pq1.empty() || 
               (pq1.size() && pq2.size() && pq2.top() < pq1.top()))
            {
                ret += pq2.top();
                pq2.pop();
                
                // add one more worker to the heap, if there are any.
                if (l <= r)
                    pq2.push(costs[r --]);
            }
            // similarly
            else 
            {
                ret += pq1.top();
                pq1.pop();
                
                if (l <= r)
                    pq1.push(costs[l ++]);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
