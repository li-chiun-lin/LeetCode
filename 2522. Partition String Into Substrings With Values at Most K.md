# Medium

You are given a string $s$ consisting of digits from $1$ to $9$ and an integer $k$.

A partition of a string $s$ is called good if:

- Each digit of $s$ is part of exactly one substring.
- The value of each substring is less than or equal to $k$.

Return the minimum number of substrings in a good partition of $s$. If no good partition of $s$ exists, return $-1$.

Note that:

- The value of a string is its result when interpreted as an integer.
- A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumPartition(string s, int k) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int v = 0;
        long long val = 0;
        
        for (char c : s)
        {
            int v = c - '0';

            if (v > k)
                return -1;

            val *= 10;
            val += v;
            
            if (val > k)
            {
                ++ cnt;
                val = v;
            }
        }
        
        return cnt + 1;
    }
};
```
