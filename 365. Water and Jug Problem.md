# Medium

You are given two jugs with capacities $jug1Capacity$ and $jug2Capacity$ liters. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. Determine whether it is possible to measure exactly $targetCapacity$ liters using these two jugs.

If $targetCapacity$ liters of water are measurable, you must have $targetCapacity$ liters of water contained within one or both buckets by the end.

Operations allowed:

- Fill any of the jugs with water.
- Empty any of the jugs.
- Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full, or the first jug itself is empty.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMeasureWater(int j1, int j2, int t) {
        if (j1 + j2 == t)
            return true;
        
        if (j1 + j2 < t)
            return false;
        
        if (j1 > j2) 
            return canMeasureWater(j2, j1, t);
        
        int v = 0;
        
        while (true) {
            if (v < j1)
                v += j2;
            else
                v -= j1;
            
            if (v == t)
                return true;
            
            if (v == 0)
                return false;
        }
    }
};
```
