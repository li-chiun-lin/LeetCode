You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string $customers$ consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':

- if the $i$-th character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the $i$-th hour
- whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the $i$-th hour.

If the shop closes at the $j$-th hour ($0 \leq j \leq n$), the penalty is calculated as follows:

- For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by $1$.
- For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by $1$.

Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.

Note that if a shop closes at the $j$-th hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour $j$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bestClosingTime(string customers) {
        int n = customers.size();
        
        vector<int> open(n + 1), close(n + 1);
        
        // the open penality of each hour
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            open[i + 1] = open[i];
            
            if (customers[i] == 'N')
                ++ open[i + 1];
        }
        
        // the close penality of each hour
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            close[i] = close[i + 1];
            
            if (customers[i] == 'Y')
                ++ close[i];
        }
        
        int ret = 0;
        
        // find the minimal
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            if (open[ret] + close[ret] > open[i] + close[i])
                ret = i;
        
        return ret;
    }
};
