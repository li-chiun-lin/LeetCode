# Medium

You are given a large sample of integers in the range $[0, 255]$. Since the sample is so large, it is represented by an array $count$ where $count[k]$ is the number of times that $k$ appears in the sample.

Calculate the following statistics:

- $minimum$: The minimum element in the sample.
- $maximum$: The maximum element in the sample.
- $mean$: The average of the sample, calculated as the total sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.
- $median$:
  - If the sample has an odd number of elements, then the $median$ is the middle element once the sample is sorted.
  - If the sample has an even number of elements, then the $median$ is the average of the two middle elements once the sample is sorted.
- $mode$: The number that appears the most in the sample. It is guaranteed to be unique.

Return the statistics of the sample as an array of floating-point numbers $[minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode]$. Answers within $10^{-5}$ of the actual answer will be accepted.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> sampleStats(vector<int>& count) {
        vector<double> ans(5);

        ans[0] = 255;
        int total = accumulate(begin(count), end(count), 0);
        int m_idx = 0;
        int m1 = (total + 1) / 2;
        int m2 = m1 + (total % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0);

        double& minimum = ans[0];
        double& maximum = ans[1];
        double& mean = ans[2];
        double& median = ans[3];
        double& mode = ans[4];

        for (int i = 0, accu = 0; i < size(count); accu += count[i ++])
        {
            minimum = count[i] ? min((int)minimum, i) : minimum;
            maximum = count[i] ? i : maximum;
            mean += (double)i * count[i] / total;

            if (accu < m1 && accu + count[i] >= m1)
                median += (double)i / 2;

            if (accu < m2 && accu + count[i] >= m2)
                median += (double)i / 2;

            if (count[mode] < count[i])
                mode = i;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
