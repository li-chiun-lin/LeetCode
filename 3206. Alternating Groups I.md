# Easy

There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers $colors$. The color of tile $i$ is represented by $colors[i]$:

- $colors[i] == 0$ means that tile $i$ is red.
- $colors[i] == 1$ means that tile $i$ is blue.

Every 3 contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (the middle tile has a different color from its left and right tiles) is called an alternating group.

Return the number of alternating groups.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfAlternatingGroups(vector<int>& colors) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = size(colors);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (colors[i] != colors[(i - 1 + n) % n] && colors[i] != colors[(i + 1) % n])
                ++ ans;
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
