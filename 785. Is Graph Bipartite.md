There is an undirected graph with **n** nodes, where each node is numbered between **0** and **n - 1**. You are given a 2D array **graph**, where **graph[u]** is an array of nodes that node **u** is adjacent to. More formally, for each **v** in **graph[u]**, there is an undirected edge between node **u** and node **v**. The graph has the following properties:

- There are no self-edges (**graph[u]** does not contain **u**).
- There are no parallel edges (**graph[u]** does not contain duplicate values).
- If **v** is in **graph[u]**, then **u** is in **graph[v]** (the graph is undirected).
- The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes **u** and **v** such that there is no path between them.

A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets **A** and **B** such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set **A** and a node in set **B**.

Return **true** if and only if it is bipartite.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<int> grp(n);
        queue<int> que;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (grp[i])
                continue;
            
            que.push(i);
            grp[i] = 1;
            
            while (que.size())
            {
                int u = que.front();
                que.pop();
                
                for (int v : graph[u])
                {
                    if (grp[v] == 0)
                    {
                        grp[v] = grp[u] == 1 ? 2 : 1;
                        que.push(v);
                    }
                    else if (grp[v] == grp[u])
                        return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true; 
    }
};
