# Easy

You are given an array $prices$ where $prices[i]$ is the price of a given stock on the $i$-th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int ret = 0;
        int low = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int p : prices)
        {
            low = min(low, p);
            ret = max(ret, p - low);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
