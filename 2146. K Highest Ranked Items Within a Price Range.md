# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array **grid** of size **m x n** that represents a map of the items in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the following:

- **0** represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
- **1** represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
- All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.

It takes **1** step to travel between adjacent grid cells.

You are also given integer arrays **pricing** and **start** where **pricing = [low, high]** and **start = [row, col]** indicates that you start at the position **(row, col)** and are interested only in items with a price in the range of **[low, high]** (inclusive). You are further given an integer **k**.

You are interested in the positions of the **k** highest-ranked items whose prices are within the given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these criteria that is different:

1. Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start (shorter distance has a higher rank).
1. Price (lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range).
1. The row number (smaller row number has a higher rank).
1. The column number (smaller column number has a higher rank).

Return the **k** highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank (highest to lowest). If there are fewer than **k** reachable items within the price range, return all of them.
