# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $buses$ of length $n$, where $buses[i]$ represents the departure time of the $i$-th bus. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array $passengers$ of length $m$, where $passengers[j]$ represents the arrival time of the $j$-th passenger. All bus departure times are unique. All passenger arrival times are unique.

You are given an integer $capacity$, which represents the maximum number of passengers that can get on each bus.

The passengers will get on the next available bus. You can get on a bus that will depart at $x$ minutes if you arrive at $y$ minutes where $y <= x$, and the bus is not full. Passengers with the earliest arrival times get on the bus first.

Return the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus. You cannot arrive at the same time as another passenger.

class Solution {
public:
    int latestTimeCatchTheBus(vector<int>& buses, vector<int>& pass, int capacity) {
        sort(begin(buses), end(buses));
        sort(begin(pass), end(pass));
        
        int i = 0;
        int p = 0;
        map<int, bool> hit;
        int last_p = 0;
        
        // for each bus
        for (int b : buses)
        {
            // abord enough passenger less than or equal to capacity
            // we keep track of the last aborded passenger 
            for (i = 0; i < capacity && p < pass.size() && pass[p] <= b; ++i)
            {
                last_p = pass[p];
                hit[last_p] = true;
                ++ p;
            }
        }
        
        // if the last bus is full, the we have to jump in before the last passenger.
        if (i == capacity)
            -- last_p;
        // otherwise, we can take our time, we only have to reach the stop before the last bus depart.
        else
            last_p = buses.back();
        
        // forward checking if the time slot has been occupied by some passenger.
        while (hit[last_p])
                -- last_p;
            
        return last_p;
