# Medium

Given a 1-indexed array of integers $numbers$ that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific $target$ number. Let these two numbers be $numbers[index_1]$ and $numbers[index_2]$ where $1 <= index_1 < index_2 <= numbers.length$.

Return the indices of the two numbers, $index_1$ and $index_2$, added by one as an integer array $[index_1, index_2]$ of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = numbers.size() - 1;
        int mid = 0;
        
        while (left < right)
        {
            mid = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
            
            if (mid > target)
                --right;
            else if (mid < target)
                ++left;
            else
                return {left + 1, right + 1};
        }
        
        return {0, 0};
    }
};
```
