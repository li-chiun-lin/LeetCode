On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing $n$ functions. Each function has a unique ID between $0$ and $n-1$.

Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list $logs$, where $logs[i]$ represents the $i$-th log message formatted as a string **"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"**. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.

A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program.

Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the $i$-th index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID $i$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> exclusiveTime(int n, vector<string>& logs) {
        vector<int> ret(n);
        stack<int> sta;
        int t1 = 0;
        
        for (auto& l : logs)
        {
            stringstream ss(l);
            string tok = "";
            char d = ':';
            
            getline(ss, tok, d);
            int id = stoi(tok);
            
            getline(ss, tok, d);
            string type = tok;
            
            getline(ss, tok, d);
            int t2 = stoi(tok);
            
            // start a call
            if (type == "start")
            {
                // if there are any running call, 
                // we conclude the time frame till now.
                if (sta.size())
                    ret[sta.top()] += t2 - t1;
                
                // start a new call and set the timestamp
                sta.push(id);
                t1 = t2;
            }
            // end a call
            else
            {
                // conclude the curret running call
                ret[sta.top()] += t2 - t1 + 1;
                
                // restore the previous call, if there are any,
                // and set the timestampe.
                // mind that the current time slot has already been used by the ended call,
                // so we have to set the timestamp + 1.
                sta.pop();
                t1 = t2 + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
