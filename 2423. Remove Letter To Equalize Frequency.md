# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed string $word$, consisting of lowercase English letters. You need to select one index and remove the letter at that index from $word$ so that the frequency of every letter present in $word$ is equal.

Return $true$ if it is possible to remove one letter so that the frequency of all letters in $word$ are equal, and $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool equalFrequency(string word) {
        map<char, int> hit;
        
        // count the frequency of each char
        for (char c : word)
            ++ hit[c];
        
        map<int, int> freq;
        
        // count the frequency of the frequency
        for (auto& h : hit)
            ++ freq[h.second];
        
        // if there is only one frequency class, 
        if (freq.size() == 1)
        {
            // if there are `n' char that have frequency 1, 
            // we can remove any one of the `n' char.
            // 
            // if there are only one char in word with frequency `m', 
            // we can remove any one char from any of the `'m appearence.
            return begin(freq)->first == 1 || begin(freq)->second == 1;
        }
        
        // if there are two frequency classes, 
        if (freq.size() == 2)
        {
            // if there is a char `c' with frequency 1, 
            // we can remove the `c'.
            if (begin(freq)->first == 1 && begin(freq)->second == 1)
                return true;

            // if the difference between the two frequency classes is 1, 
            // and the there is only 1 char `c' with higher frequency than other `n' char,
            // we can remove a char `c'. 
            if (rbegin(freq)->first - begin(freq)->first == 1 && rbegin(freq)->second == 1)
                return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
