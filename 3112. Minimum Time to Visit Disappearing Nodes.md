There is an undirected graph of $n$ nodes. You are given a 2D array $edges$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, length_i]$ describes an edge between node $u_i$ and node $v_i$ with a traversal time of $length_i$ units.

Additionally, you are given an array $disappear$, where $disappear[i]$ denotes the time when the node $i$ disappears from the graph and you won't be able to visit it.

Notice that the graph might be disconnected and might contain multiple edges.

Return the array $answer$, with $answer[i]$ denoting the minimum units of time required to reach node $i$ from node $0$. If node $i$ is unreachable from node $0$ then $answer[i]$ is $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minimumTime(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& disappear) {
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back({e[1], e[2]});
            adj[e[1]].push_back({e[0], e[2]});
        }
        
        vector<int> dst(n, -1);
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> pq;
        
        pq.push({0, 0});

        while (size(pq))
        {
            auto [t, u] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            if (dst[u] != -1)
                continue;

            dst[u] = t;

            for (auto [v, w] : adj[u])
                if (dst[v] == -1 && t + w < disappear[v])
                    pq.push({t + w, v});
        }
        
        return dst;
    }
};
```
