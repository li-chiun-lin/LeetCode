A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function **Successor(x, curOrder)**, which given a person **x** and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after **x** in the order of inheritance.

```text
Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder
```

Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.

Implement the **ThroneInheritance** class:

- **ThroneInheritance(string kingName)** Initializes an object of the **ThroneInheritance** class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.
- **void birth(string parentName, string childName)** Indicates that **parentName** gave birth to **childName**.
- **void death(string name)** Indicates the death of **name**. The death of the person doesn't affect the **Successor** function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.
- **string[] getInheritanceOrder()** Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.

```cpp
class ThroneInheritance {
    map<string, bool> isAlive;
    map<string, vector<string>> descendant;
    string king;
    
public:
    ThroneInheritance(string kingName) {
        king = kingName;
        isAlive[king] = true;
    }
    
    void birth(string parentName, string childName) {
        descendant[parentName].push_back(childName);
        isAlive[childName] = true;
    }
    
    void death(string name) {
        isAlive[name] = false;
    }
    
    void dfs(string &x, vector<string> &ret)
    {
        if (isAlive[x])
            ret.push_back(x);
        
        for (string &c : descendant[x])
            dfs(c, ret);
    }
    
    vector<string> getInheritanceOrder() {
        vector<string> ord;
        
        dfs(king, ord);
        
        return ord;
    }
};
```
