# Hard

There is a 2D $grid$ of size $n \times n$ where each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially turned off.

You are given a 2D array of lamp positions $lamps$, where $lamps[i] = [row_i, col_i]$ indicates that the lamp at $grid[row_i][col_i]$ is turned on. Even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.

When a lamp is turned on, it illuminates its cell and all other cells in the same row, column, or diagonal.

You are also given another 2D array $queries$, where $queries[j] = [row_j, col_j]$. For the $j$-th query, determine whether $grid[row_j][col_j]$ is illuminated or not. After answering the $j$-th query, turn off the lamp at $grid[row_j][col_j]$ and its 8 adjacent lamps if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with $grid[row_j][col_j]$.

Return an array of integers $ans$, where $ans[j]$ should be $1$ if the cell in the $j$-th query was illuminated, or $0$ if the lamp was not.
