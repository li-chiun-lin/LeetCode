# Easy

Given a string $text$, you want to use the characters of $text$ to form as many instances of the word **"balloon"** as possible.

You can use each character in $text$ at most once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfBalloons(string text) {
        vector<int> hist(26);
        
        for (char c : text)
            ++ hist[c - 'a'];
        
        int m = INT_MAX;
        
        m = min(m, hist['b' - 'a']);
        m = min(m, hist['a' - 'a']);
        m = min(m, hist['l' - 'a'] / 2);
        m = min(m, hist['o' - 'a'] / 2);
        m = min(m, hist['n' - 'a']);
        
        return m;
    }
};
```
