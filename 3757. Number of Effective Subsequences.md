# Hard

You are given an integer array $nums$.

The strength of the array is defined as the bitwise OR of all its elements.

A subsequence is considered effective if removing that subsequence strictly decreases the strength of the remaining elements.

Return the number of effective subsequences in $nums$. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

The bitwise OR of an empty array is $0$.
