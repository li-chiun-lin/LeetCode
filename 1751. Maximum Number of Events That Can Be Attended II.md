# Hard

You are given an array of $events$ where $events[i] = [startDay_i, endDay_i, value_i]$. The $i$-th event starts at $startDay_i$ and ends at $endDay_i$, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of $value_i$. You are also given an integer $k$ which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k) {
        int n = events.size();

        // Sort events by their end time
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());

        // Precompute the "next non-overlapping event" index for each event
        vector<int> next(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int lo = i + 1, hi = n;
            while (lo < hi) {
                int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
                if (events[mid][0] > events[i][1])
                    hi = mid;
                else
                    lo = mid + 1;
            }
            next[i] = lo;
        }

        // dp[i][j] = max value using first i events with j events selected
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
                // Option 1: skip this event
                int skip = dp[i + 1][j];

                // Option 2: take this event
                int take = events[i][2] + dp[next[i]][j - 1];

                dp[i][j] = max(skip, take);
            }
        }

        return dp[0][k];
    }
};
