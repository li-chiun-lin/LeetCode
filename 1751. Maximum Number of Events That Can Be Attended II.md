# Hard

You are given an array of $events$ where $events[i] = [startDay_i, endDay_i, value_i]$. The $i$-th event starts at $startDay_i$ and ends at $endDay_i$, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of $value_i$. You are also given an integer $k$ which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k, int i, vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        int n = events.size();

        if (i >= n || k == 0)
            return 0;

        if (dp[i][k] != -1)
            return dp[i][k];

#if 0
        int j = 0;

        for (j = i + 1; j < n; ++j)
            if (events[i][1] < events[j][0])
                break;
#endif
        int j = upper_bound(begin(events) + i + 1, end(events), vector<int>{events[i][1], INT_MAX, INT_MAX}) - begin(events);

        int dont = dfs(events, k, i + 1, dp);
        int take = dfs(events, k - 1, j, dp) + events[i][2];

        return dp[i][k] = max(dont, take);
    }

public:
    int maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k) {
        int n = events.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, -1));

        sort(begin(events), end(events));

        return dfs(events, k, 0, dp);
    }
};
