# Easy

You are given a string $s$ and an integer $k$.

Determine if there exists a substring of length exactly $k$ in $s$ that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The substring consists of only one distinct character.
2. If there is a character immediately before the substring, it must be different from the character in the substring.
3. If there is a character immediately after the substring, it must also be different from the character in the substring.

Return $true$ if such a substring exists. Otherwise, return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check if there is a special substring in the string `s`
    bool hasSpecialSubstring(string s, int k) {
        char val = 0;  // Variable to track the current character
        int cnt = 0;   // Counter to track consecutive occurrences of `val`
        int n = size(s); // Get the size of the string
        
        // Loop through each character of the string
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // If the current character is different from `val`, reset the counter
            if (val != s[i]) {
                val = s[i];
                cnt = 0; // Reset counter as we're dealing with a different character
            }
            
            // Increment the counter for consecutive occurrences of `val`
            if (++cnt == k) {
                // Check if there is a valid previous character that matches `val`
                // If the character at position `i - k` is the same as `val`, continue
                // or if the next character in the string is the same as `val`, continue
                // Otherwise, return true for a special substring
                if (0 <= i - k && s[i - k] == val)
                    ;
                else if (i + 1 < n && s[i + 1] == val)
                    ;
                else
                    return true; // A special substring found
            }
        }
        
        // Return false if no special substring is found
        return false;
    }
};
```
