# Easy

You are given a string $sentence$ that consist of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

- If a word begins with a vowel (**'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'**), append **"ma"** to the end of the word.
- If a word begins with a consonant, remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add **"ma"**.
- Add one letter **'a'** to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with $1$.

Return the final sentence representing the conversion from sentence to Goat Latin.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string toGoatLatin(string sentence) {
        string ret = "";
        stringstream ss(sentence);
        string tok = "";
        int idx = 1;
        
        while (ss >> tok)
        {
            if (! (tok[0] == 'a' || tok[0] == 'e' || 
                   tok[0] == 'i' || tok[0] == 'o' || tok[0] == 'u' ||
                   tok[0] == 'A' || tok[0] == 'E' || 
                   tok[0] == 'I' || tok[0] == 'O' || tok[0] == 'U'))
                tok = tok.substr(1) + tok[0];
        
            ret += tok + "ma" + string(idx, 'a') + " ";
            
            ++ idx;
        }
        
        while (ret.back() == ' ')
            ret.pop_back();
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
