# Medium

You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a 0-indexed integer array **security**, where **security[i]** is the number of guards on duty on the **i**-th day. The days are numbered starting from **0**. You are also given an integer **time**.

The **i**-th day is a good day to rob the bank if:

- There are at least **time** days before and after the **i**-th day,
- The number of guards at the bank for the **time** days before **i** are non-increasing, and
- The number of guards at the bank for the **time** days after **i** are non-decreasing.

More formally, this means day **i** is a good day to rob the bank if and only if **security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time]**.

Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order that the days are returned in does not matter.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> goodDaysToRobBank(vector<int>& security, int time) {
        int n = security.size();
        vector<int> ret;
        vector<int> before(n);
        vector<int> after(n);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            if (security[i - 1] >= security[i])
                before[i] = before[i - 1] + 1;
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)
            if (security[i] <= security[i + 1])
                after[i] = after[i + 1] + 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (before[i] >= time && after[i] >= time)
                ret.push_back(i);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
