# Medium

You are given an integer array $nums$. A subsequence of $nums$ is called a square streak if:

- The length of the subsequence is at least $2$, and
- after sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the square of the previous number.

Return the length of the longest square streak in $nums$, or return $-1$ if there is no square streak.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSquareStreak(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ret = 0;
        // sorted by default, and remove duplicate, if there are any.
        set<int> ss(begin(nums), end(nums));
        
        // for each element, from small to large
        // caution with variable overflow.
        for (unsigned long long x : ss)
        {
            int len = 1;
            
            // find the longest length of square.
            while (ss.count(x = x * x))
            {
                // optimazation: remove it to avoid repeat computation.
                ss.erase(x);
                ++ len;
            }
            
            ret = max(ret, len);
        }
        
        // the final cautious.
        return ret > 1 ? ret : -1;
    }
};
```
