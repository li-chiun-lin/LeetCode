# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $brackets$ where $brackets[i] = [upper_i, percent_i]$ means that the $i$-th tax bracket has an upper bound of $upper_i$ and is taxed at a rate of $percent_i$. The brackets are sorted by upper bound (i.e. $upper_{i-1} < upper_i$ for $0 < i < brackets.length$).

Tax is calculated as follows:

- The first $upper_0$ dollars earned are taxed at a rate of $percent_0$.
- The next $upper_1 - upper_0$ dollars earned are taxed at a rate of $percent_1$.
- The next $upper_2 - upper_1$ dollars earned are taxed at a rate of $percent_2$.
- And so on.

You are given an integer $income$ representing the amount of money you earned. Return the amount of money that you have to pay in taxes. Answers within $10^{-5}$ of the actual answer will be accepted.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double calculateTax(vector<vector<int>>& brackets, int income) {
        int n = brackets.size();
        
        double d = min(brackets[0][0], income);
        double ret = d * brackets[0][1] / 100;
        income -= d;

        for (int i = 1; i < n && income; ++i)
        {
            // this is a trick to make more concise code.
            d = min(brackets[i][0] - brackets[i - 1][0], income);
            ret += d * brackets[i][1] / 100;
            income -= d;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
