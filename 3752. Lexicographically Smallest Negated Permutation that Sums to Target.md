# Medium

You are given a positive integer $n$ and an integer $target$.

Return the lexicographically smallest array of integers of size $n$ such that:

- The sum of its elements equals $target$.
- The absolute values of its elements form a permutation of size $n$.

If no such array exists, return an empty array.

A permutation of size $n$ is a rearrangement of integers $1, 2, ..., n$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> lexSmallestNegatedPerm(int n, long long target) {
        long long sum = (long long)n * (n + 1) / 2;
        long long diff = sum - target;

        if (target < -sum || target > sum || diff % 2)
            return {};

        vector<int> vec;

        for (int x = n; x >= 1; --x)
        {
            if (x * 2 <= diff)
            {
                vec.push_back(-x);
                diff -= x * 2;
            }
            else
            {
                vec.push_back(x);
            }
        }

        sort(begin(vec), end(vec));

        return vec;
    }
};
```
