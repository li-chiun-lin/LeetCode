Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a non-empty subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion. In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.

Note that the subarray needs to be non-empty after deleting one element.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumSum(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        
        // corner case
        if (n == 1)
            return arr[0];
        
        // when there are two elements,
        // if we already delete one element,
        int delete1 = max(arr[0], arr[1]);
        // if we do not delete any element yet, 
        // then it could be arr[0] + arr[1], or
        // it could also be arr[1].
        int delete0 = max(arr[0], 0) + arr[1];
        
        int ret = max(delete0, delete1);
        
        // when there are more elements,
        for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i)
        {
            // how do we acquire the `delete one element' case?
            // we can get it from previously `delete zero element' and do not add the current arr[i], or
            // we can get it from previously `delete one element' and then add the current arr[i], 
            // in either case, we maintain `delete one element', be it the current arr[i] or some other element before.
            delete1 = max(delete0, delete1 + arr[i]);
            // And how do we acquire the `delete zero element' case?
            // we get it from previously `delete zero element' and then add the current element, or
            // we can start A new subarray from here, the arr[i].
            delete0 = max(delete0 + arr[i], arr[i]);
            
            ret = max(ret, max(delete0, delete1));
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
