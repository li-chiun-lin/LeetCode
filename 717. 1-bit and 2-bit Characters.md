# Easy

We have two special characters:

- The first character can be represented by one bit $0$.
- The second character can be represented by two bits ($10$ or $11$).

Given a binary array $bits$ that ends with $0$, return $true$ if the last character must be a one-bit character.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        int i = 0;
        int n1 = bits.size() - 1;
        
        while (i < n1)
        {
            if (bits[i])
                ++ i;
            
            ++ i;
        }
        
        return i == n1;
    }
};
```
