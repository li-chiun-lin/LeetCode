You are given two strings $word1$ and $word2$.

A string $x$ is called almost equal to $y$ if you can change at most one character in $x$ to make it identical to $y$.

A sequence of indices $seq$ is called valid if:

- The indices are sorted in ascending order.
- Concatenating the characters at these indices in $word1$ in the same order results in a string that is almost equal to $word2$.

Return an array of size $word2.length$ representing the lexicographically smallest valid sequence of indices. If no such sequence of indices exists, return an empty array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> validSequence(string word1, string word2) {
        int n = size(word1);
        int m = size(word2);
        int j = m - 1;
        vector<int> vec(n + 1);
        vec[n] = m;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            vec[i] = vec[i + 1];

            if (j >= 0 && word1[i] == word2[j])
                vec[i] = j --;
        }

        j = 0;
        int sp = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (word1[i] == word2[j])
                ++ j;
            else if (vec[i + 1] <= j + 1)
            {
                sp = j;
                break;
            }
        }

        j = 0;
        vector<int> ans;

        for (int i = 0; i < n && j < m; ++i)
            if (j == sp || word1[i] == word2[j])
            {
                ans.push_back(i);
                ++ j;
            }

        return size(ans) < m ? vector<int>(0) : ans;
    }
};
