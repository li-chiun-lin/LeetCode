# Hard

You are given an integer $n$ indicating the number of people in a network. Each person is labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$.

You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $restrictions$, where $restrictions[i] = [x_i, y_i]$ means that person $x_i$ and person $y_i$ cannot become friends, either directly or indirectly through other people.

Initially, no one is friends with each other. You are given a list of friend requests as a 0-indexed 2D integer array $requests$, where $requests[j] = [u_j, v_j]$ is a friend request between person $u_j$ and person $v_j$.

A friend request is successful if $u_j$ and $v_j$ can be friends. Each friend request is processed in the given order, and upon a successful request, $u_j$ and $v_j$ become direct friends for all future friend requests.

Return a boolean array $result$, where each $result[j]$ is $true$ if the $j$-th friend request is successful or $false$ if it is not.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> friendRequests(int n, vector<vector<int>>& restrictions, vector<vector<int>>& requests) {
        vector<int> g(n);
        iota(begin(g), end(g), 0);

        function<int(int)> find = [&](int x)
        {
            return g[x] == x ? x : g[x] = find(g[x]);
        };

        auto join = [&](int x, int y)
        {
            g[find(x)] = find(y);
        };

        vector<bool> ans;

        for (auto& q : requests)
        {
            int u = find(q[0]);
            int v = find(q[1]);
            int valid = true;

            if (find(u) != find(v))
            {
                for (auto& r : restrictions)
                {
                    int x = find(r[0]);
                    int y = find(r[1]);

                    if ((x == u && y == v) || (x == v && y == u))
                    {
                        valid = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }

            ans.push_back(valid);
            if (valid)
                join(u, v);
        }

        return ans;
    }
