# Medium

In a mystic dungeon, $n$ magicians are standing in a line. Each magician has an attribute that gives you energy. Some magicians can give you negative energy, which means taking energy from you.

You have been cursed in such a way that after absorbing energy from magician $i$, you will be instantly transported to magician $(i + k)$. This process will be repeated until you reach the magician where $(i + k)$ does not exist.

In other words, you will choose a starting point and then teleport with $k$ jumps until you reach the end of the magicians' sequence, absorbing all the energy during the journey.

You are given an array $energy$ and an integer $k$. Return the maximum possible energy you can gain.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumEnergy(vector<int>& energy, int k) {
        int ans = INT_MIN;
        int n = size(energy);
        
        for (int x = 0; x < k; ++x)
        {
            vector<int> vec;
            
            for (int j = x; j < n; j += k)
                vec.push_back(energy[j]);
            
            int sum = 0;
            
            for (int e = size(vec) - 1; e >= 0; --e)
            {
                sum += vec[e];
                ans = max(ans, sum);
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumEnergy(vector<int>& energy, int k) {
        int ans = INT_MIN;
        int n = size(energy);
        
        for (int x = 0; x < k; ++x)
            for (int j = n - 1 - x, sum = 0; j >= 0; j -= k)
                ans = max(ans, sum += energy[j]);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
