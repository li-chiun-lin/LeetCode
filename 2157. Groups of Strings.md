# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings $words$. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only. No letter occurs more than once in any string of $words$.

Two strings $s1$ and $s2$ are said to be connected if the set of letters of $s2$ can be obtained from the set of letters of $s1$ by any one of the following operations:

- Adding exactly one letter to the set of the letters of $s1$.
- Deleting exactly one letter from the set of the letters of $s1$.
- Replacing exactly one letter from the set of the letters of $s1$ with any letter, including itself.

The array $words$ can be divided into one or more non-intersecting groups. A string belongs to a group if any one of the following is true:

- It is connected to at least one other string of the group.
- It is the only string present in the group.

Note that the strings in $words$ should be grouped in such a manner that a string belonging to a group cannot be connected to a string present in any other group. It can be proved that such an arrangement is always unique.

Return an array $ans$ of size $2$ where:

- $ans[0]$ is the maximum number of groups $words$ can be divided into, and
- $ans[1]$ is the size of the largest group.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> groupStrings(vector<string>& words) {
        map<int, int> mp;
        int group = 0;
        int size = 0;

        function<int(int)> dfs = [&](int mask)
        {
            int ans = 0;
            auto it = mp.find(mask);

            if (it == end(mp))
                return 0;

            ans += it->second;
            mp.erase(it);

            for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
            {
                ans += dfs(mask ^ (1 << i));

                for (int j = i + 1; j < 26; ++j)
                    if (((mask >> i) & 1) != 
                        ((mask >> j) & 1))
                        ans += dfs(mask ^ (1 << i) ^ (1 << j));
            }

            return ans;
        };

        for (auto& w : words)
            ++ mp[accumulate(begin(w), end(w), 0, 
                [](int m, char c) { return m | (1 << (c - 'a')); })];

        while (mp.size())
        {
            auto s = dfs(begin(mp)->first);
            size = max(size, s);
            group += s > 0;
        }

        return {group, size};
    }
