Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the $n$-th lake, the $n$-th lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.

Given an integer array $rains$ where:

- $rains[i] > 0$ means there will be rains over the $rains[i]$ lake.
- $rains[i] == 0$ means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.

Return an array $ans$ where:

- $ans.length == rains.length$
- $ans[i] == -1$ if $rains[i] > 0$.
- $ans[i]$ is the lake you choose to dry in the $i$-th day if $rains[i] == 0$.

If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> avoidFlood(vector<int>& rains) {
        int n = rains.size();
        // set default value to 1 for no particular reason.
        vector<int> ans(n, 1);
        // those days we can dry a lake.
        set<int> dry_day;
        // the day when the particular lake is full.
        map<int, int> full;
        
        // for each day
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            // if it is rainning
            if (rains[i])
            {
                // if the lake is full
                if (full[rains[i]])
                {
                    // we try to find a possible sunny day in the past since the day this lake was filled.
                    auto it = dry_day.lower_bound(full[rains[i]]);
                    
                    // if we can not find a possible day, return fail.
                    if (it == dry_day.end())
                        return {};
                    
                    // set the day to dry this lake
                    ans[*it] = rains[i];
                    // the chosen day can no longer be available.
                    dry_day.erase(it);
                }
                
                // record the day when this lake is filled.
                full[rains[i]] = i + 1;
                // the ans of raining day is always -1
                ans[i] = -1;
            }
            else // if it's sunny
            {
                dry_day.insert(i);
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
