You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ of length $n$.

The numbers from $0$ to $n - 1$ are divided into three groups numbered from $1$ to $3$, where number $i$ belongs to group $nums[i]$. Notice that some groups may be empty.

You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times:

- Pick number $x$ and change its group.

A new array $res$ is constructed using the following procedure:

- Sort the numbers in each group independently.
- Append the elements of groups $1$, $2$, and $3$ to $res$ in this order.

Array $nums$ is called a beautiful array if the constructed array $res$ is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return the minimum number of operations to make $nums$ a beautiful array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int ret = n;

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
            for (int j = i; j <= n; ++j)
            {
                int c = 0;

                for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k)
                {
                    if (k < i)
                        c += nums[k] != 1;
                    else if (k < j)
                        c += nums[k] != 2;
                    else
                        c += nums[k] != 3;
                }

                ret = min(ret, c);
            }

        return ret;
    }
};
