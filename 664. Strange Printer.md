# Hard

There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:

- The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
- At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the original existing characters.

Given a string $s$, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int strangePrinter(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            dp[i][i] = 1;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j)
            {
                for (int k = i; k < j; ++k)
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j]);

                if (s[i] == s[j])
                    -- dp[i][j];
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```
