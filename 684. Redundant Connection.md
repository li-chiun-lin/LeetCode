In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $1$ to $n$, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from $1$ to $n$, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array $edges$ of length $n$ where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of $n$ nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool bfs(vector<vector<int>>& adj, int src, int dst)
    {
        queue<int> que;
        vector<bool> visited(adj.size());
        
        que.push(src);
        visited[src] = true;
        
        while (que.size())
        {
            int u = que.front();
            que.pop();
            
            if (u == dst)
                return true;
            
            for (int v : adj[u])
                if (! visited[v])
                {
                    visited[v] = true;
                    que.push(v);
                }
        }
        
        return false;
    }

public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            if (bfs(adj, e[0], e[1]))
                return e;
            
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        
        return {0, 0};
    }
};
