In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $1$ to $n$, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from $1$ to $n$, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array $edges$ of length $n$ where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of $n$ nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
private:
    // Perform BFS to check if a path exists between `src` and `dst`
    bool isConnected(vector<vector<int>>& adj, int src, int dst) 
    {
        queue<int> que;
        vector<bool> visited(adj.size(), false);
        
        que.push(src);
        visited[src] = true;
        
        while (!que.empty()) 
        {
            int node = que.front();
            que.pop();
            
            if (node == dst) 
                return true;
            
            for (int neighbor : adj[node]) 
            {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) 
                {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    que.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }

    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) 
    {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);

        for (const auto& edge : edges) 
        {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];

            // If adding this edge creates a cycle, return the edge
            if (isConnected(adj, u, v)) 
                return edge;

            // Otherwise, add the edge to the adjacency list
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u);
        }
        
        return {0, 0}; // Default return value (should not be reached)
    }
};
