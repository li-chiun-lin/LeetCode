# Easy

There are $n$ employees, each with a unique id from $0$ to $n - 1$.

You are given a 2D integer array $logs$ where $logs[i] = [id_i, leaveTime_i]$ where:

- $id_i$ is the id of the employee that worked on the $i$-th task, and
- $leaveTime_i$ is the time at which the employee finished the $i$-th task. All the values $leaveTime_i$ are unique.

Note that the ith task starts the moment right after the (i - 1)th task ends, and the 0th task starts at time 0.

Return the id of the employee that worked the task with the longest time. If there is a tie between two or more employees, return the smallest id among them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hardestWorker(int n, vector<vector<int>>& logs) {
        map<int, vector<int>> work;
        int prv = 0;
        
        for (auto& x : logs)
        {
            work[x[1] - prv].push_back(x[0]);
            prv = x[1];
        }
        
        auto longest = rbegin(work)->second;
        return *min_element(begin(longest), end(longest));
    }
};
```
