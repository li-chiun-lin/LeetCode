# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $nums$. Initially, your score is $0$. Perform the following operations until the matrix becomes empty:

- From each row in the matrix, select the largest number and remove it. In the case of a tie, it does not matter which number is chosen.
- Identify the highest number amongst all those removed in step 1. Add that number to your score.

Return the final score.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int matrixSum(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        int m = nums.size();
        int n = nums[0].size();
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (auto& r : nums)
            sort(rbegin(r), rend(r));
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
        {
            int v = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
                v = max(v, nums[i][j]);
            
            ret += v;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
