# Medium

You are given a (0-indexed) array of positive integers **candiesCount** where **candiesCount[i]** represents the number of candies of the **i**-th type you have. You are also given a 2D array **queries** where $queries[i] = [favoriteType_i, favoriteDay_i, dailyCap_i]$.

You play a game with the following rules:

- You start eating candies on day **0**.
- You cannot eat any candy of type **i** unless you have eaten all candies of type **i - 1**.
- You must eat at least one candy per day until you have eaten all the candies.

Construct a boolean array **answer** such that **answer.length == queries.length** and **answer[i]** is **true** if you can eat a candy of type $favoriteType_i$ on day $favoriteDay_i$ without eating more than $dailyCap_i$ candies on any day, and **false** otherwise. Note that you can eat different types of candy on the same day, provided that you follow rule 2.

Return the constructed array answer.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> canEat(vector<int>& candiesCount, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int n = candiesCount.size();
        vector<long> acc(n + 1);
        vector<bool> ret;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            acc[i + 1] = acc[i] + candiesCount[i];
        
        for (auto &q : queries)
        {
            long lb = acc[q[0]] / q[2];
            long ub = acc[q[0] + 1];
            
            ret.push_back(lb < q[1] + 1 && ub > q[1]);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
