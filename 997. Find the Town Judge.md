# Easy

In a town, there are $n$ people labeled from $1$ to $n$. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

- The town judge trusts nobody.
- Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
- There is exactly one person that satisfies properties $1$ and $2$.

You are given an array $trust$ where $trust[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ representing that the person labeled $a_i$ trusts the person labeled $b_i$.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return $-1$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        vector<int> cnt(n + 1);
        vector<bool> tt(n + 1);
        
        for (auto &v : trust)
        {
            ++ cnt[v[1]];
            tt[v[0]] = true;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            if (cnt[i] == n - 1 && ! tt[i])
                return i;
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```
