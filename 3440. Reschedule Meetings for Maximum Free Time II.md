# Medium

You are given an integer $eventTime$ denoting the duration of an event. You are also given two integer arrays $startTime$ and $endTime$, each of length $n$.

These represent the start and end times of $n$ non-overlapping meetings that occur during the event between time $t = 0$ and time $t = eventTime$, where the $i$-th meeting occurs during the time $[startTime[i], endTime[i]]$.

You can reschedule at most one meeting by moving its start time while maintaining the same duration, such that the meetings remain non-overlapping, to maximize the longest continuous period of free time during the event.

Return the maximum amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime) 
    {
        // Add the event end time to the startTime vector to simplify gap calculations
        startTime.push_back(eventTime);

        int n = startTime.size();
        vector<int> gaps(n + 1, 0); // Store gaps between consecutive events
        vector<int> right(n + 1, 0); // Stores the maximum gap to the right of each event

        // Initial gap is from time 0 to the start of the first event
        gaps[0] = startTime[0];
        
        // Calculate gaps between the end of one event and the start of the next
        // Populate the right array with maximum gaps from right to left
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i)
        {
            gaps[i] = startTime[i] - endTime[i - 1];
            right[i] = max(right[i + 1], gaps[i + 1]);
        }

        right[0] = max(right[1], gaps[1]);

        int ans = 0; // To store the maximum free time found
        int left = 0; // To keep track of the maximum gap to the left of the current event

        // Iterate through each event to calculate potential maximum free times
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int cur = endTime[i - 1] - startTime[i - 1]; // Duration of the current event

            // Check if merging current event duration with gaps gives a better result
            if (cur <= max(left, right[i]))
            {
                ans = max(ans, gaps[i - 1] + cur + gaps[i]);
            }

            // Update answer considering just the sum of adjacent gaps
            ans = max(ans, gaps[i - 1] + gaps[i]);

            // Update the left maximum gap
            left = max(left, gaps[i - 1]);
        }

        return ans; // Return the maximum free time found
    }
};
