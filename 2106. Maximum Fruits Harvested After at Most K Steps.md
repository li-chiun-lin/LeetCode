Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array $fruits$ where $fruits[i] = [position_i, amount_i]$ depicts $amount_i$ fruits at the position $position_i$. fruits is already sorted by $position_i$ in ascending order, and each $position_i$ is unique.

You are also given an integer $startPos$ and an integer $k$. Initially, you are at the position $startPos$. From any position, you can either walk to the left or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can walk at most $k$ steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.

Return the maximum total number of fruits you can harvest.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxTotalFruits(vector<vector<int>>& fruits, int startPos, int k) {
        auto left = upper_bound(begin(fruits), end(fruits), vector<int>{startPos - k});
        int ub = startPos + k;
        int sum = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for (auto right = left; right != end(fruits) && (*right)[0] <= ub; ++right)
        {
            int right_pos = (*right)[0];
            int right_amount = (*right)[1];
            int left_pos = (*left)[0];
            int left_amount = (*left)[1];

            sum += right_amount;

            while (min(startPos - 2 * left_pos + right_pos, 2 * right_pos - left_pos - startPos) > k)
            {
                sum -= left_amount;
                ++ left;
                left_pos = (*left)[0];
                left_amount = (*left)[1];
            }

            ans = max(ans, sum);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
