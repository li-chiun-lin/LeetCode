You are given two 0-indexed arrays of strings **startWords** and **targetWords**. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only.

For each string in **targetWords**, check if it is possible to choose a string from **startWords** and perform a conversion operation on it to be equal to that from **targetWords**.

The conversion operation is described in the following two steps:

1. **Append** any lowercase letter that is not present in the string to its end.
    - For example, if the string is "abc", the letters 'd', 'e', or 'y' can be added to it, but not 'a'. If 'd' is added, the resulting string will be "abcd".
1. **Rearrange** the letters of the new string in any arbitrary order.
    - For example, "abcd" can be rearranged to "acbd", "bacd", "cbda", and so on. Note that it can also be rearranged to "abcd" itself.

Return the number of strings in **targetWords** that can be obtained by performing the operations on any string of **startWords**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int wordCount(vector<string>& startWords, vector<string>& targetWords) {
        int m = startWords.size();
        int n = targetWords.size();
        vector<int> tw(n);
        map<int, bool> sw;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        {
            int b = 0;
            
            for (char c : startWords[i])
                b |= 1 << (c - 'a');
            
            sw[b] = true;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int b = 0;
            
            for (char c : targetWords[i])
                b |= 1 << (c - 'a');
            
            tw[i] = b;
        }
        
        int c = 0;
        
        for (int t : tw)
        {
            for (int bb = 0; bb < 26; ++bb)
            {
                int mask = 1 << bb;
                
                if (t & mask)
                {
                    if (sw[t ^ mask])
                    {
                        ++ c;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return c;
    }
};
```
