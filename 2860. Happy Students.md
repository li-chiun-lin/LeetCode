You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ of length $n$ where $n$ is the total number of students in the class. The class teacher tries to select a group of students so that all the students remain happy.

The $i$-th student will become happy if one of these two conditions is met:

- The student is selected and the total number of selected students is strictly greater than $nums[i]$.
- The student is not selected and the total number of selected students is strictly less than $nums[i]$.

Return the number of ways to select a group of students so that everyone remains happy.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countWays(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));

        int n = size(nums);
        int selected = 0;
        int ret = !! nums[0];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (++ selected > nums[i])
                if (i + 1 == n || (i + 1 < n && selected < nums[i + 1]))
                    ++ ret;

        return ret;
    }
};
```
