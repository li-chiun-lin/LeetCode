# Easy

You are given three strings $s1, s2,$ and $s3$. You have to perform the following operation on these three strings as many times as you want.

In one operation you can choose one of these three strings such that its length is at least 2 and delete the rightmost character of it.

Return the minimum number of operations you need to perform to make the three strings equal if there is a way to make them equal, otherwise, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinimumOperations(string s1, string s2, string s3) {
        int i = 0;
        int n = min(size(s1), min(size(s2), size(s3)));
        
        while (i < n && s1[i] == s2[i] && s2[i] == s3[i])
            ++ i;
        
        return i ? size(s1) - i + size(s2) - i + size(s3) - i : -1;
    }
};
```
