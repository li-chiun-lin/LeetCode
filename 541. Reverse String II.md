# Easy

Given a string $s$ and an integer $k$, reverse the first $k$ characters for every $2k$ characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than $k$ characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than $2k$ but greater than or equal to $k$ characters, then reverse the first $k$ characters and leave the other as original.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        int n = s.size();
        
        while (i + k < n)
        {
            reverse(s.begin() + i, s.begin() + i + k);
            i += 2 * k;
        }
        
        if (i < n)
            reverse(s.begin() + i, s.end());
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
