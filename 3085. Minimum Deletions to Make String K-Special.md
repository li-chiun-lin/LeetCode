You are given a string $word$ and an integer $k$.

We consider $word$ to be $k$-special if $|freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| \leq k$ for all indices $i$ and $j$ in the string.

Return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make $word$ $k$-special.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(string word, int k) {
        // Frequency array for each character (assuming lowercase English letters)
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);

        // Count frequency of each character in the input string
        for (char c : word)
            ++freq[c - 'a'];

        int minDeletions = INT_MAX;

        // Try using each frequency value x as the base frequency
        for (int x : freq) {
            // Skip unused characters
            if (x == 0) continue;

            int deletions = 0;

            for (int y : freq) {
                if (y == 0) continue;

                // If frequency is less than x, delete all occurrences
                if (y < x)
                    deletions += y;
                // If frequency is more than x + k, delete the excess
                else if (y > x + k)
                    deletions += y - (x + k);
            }

            // Keep track of the minimal total deletions required
            minDeletions = min(minDeletions, deletions);
        }

        return minDeletions;
    }
};
