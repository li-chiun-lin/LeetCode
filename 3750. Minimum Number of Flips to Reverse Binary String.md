# Easy

You are given a positive integer $n$.

Let $s$ be the binary representation of $n$ without leading zeros.

The reverse of a binary string $s$ is obtained by writing the characters of $s$ in the opposite order.

You may flip any bit in $s$ (change $0 → 1$ or $1 → 0$). Each flip affects exactly one bit.

Return the minimum number of flips required to make $s$ equal to the reverse of its original form.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumFlips(int n) {
        vector<int> b;

        while (n)
        {
            b.push_back(n & 1);
            n >>= 1;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        int m = size(b);

        for (int i = 0, j = m - 1; i < j; ++i, --j)
            if (b[i] != b[j])
                ans += 2;

        return ans;
    }
};
```
