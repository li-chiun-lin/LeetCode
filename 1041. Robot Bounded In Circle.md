# Medium

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at $(0, 0)$ and faces north. Note that:

- The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
- The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
- The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
- The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.

The robot can receive one of three instructions:

- **"G"**: go straight 1 unit.
- **"L"**: turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
- **"R"**: turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).

The robot performs the $instructions$ given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return $true$ if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isRobotBounded(string ins) {
        int dx[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
        int dy[4] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
        
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        int d = 0;
        
        for (char i : ins)
        {
            if (i == 'L')
                d = (d - 1 + 4) % 4;
            else if (i == 'R')
                d = (d + 1) % 4;
            else
            {
                x += dx[d];
                y += dy[d];
            }
        }
        
        return (x == 0 && y == 0) || d != 0;
    }
};
```
