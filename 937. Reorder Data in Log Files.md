You are given an array of $logs$. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:

- Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
- Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

Reorder these logs so that:

- The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
- The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
- The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.

```cpp
bool cmp_letter(string &a, string &b)
{
    stringstream ssa(a);
    stringstream ssb(b);
    string ida = "";
    string idb = "";
    
    ssa >> ida;
    ssb >> idb;
    
    string cont_a = a.substr(ida.size());
    string cont_b = b.substr(idb.size());
    
    //The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
    return cont_a < cont_b || (cont_a == cont_b && ida < idb);
}

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> reorderLogFiles(vector<string>& logs) {
        vector<string> letter;
        vector<string> digit;
        
        for (string &str : logs)
        {
            stringstream ss(str);
            string id = "";
            
            ss >> id;
            string rest = str.substr(id.size() + 1);
            
            if (isdigit(rest[0]))
                digit.push_back(str);
            else
                letter.push_back(str);
        }
        
        sort(letter.begin(), letter.end(), cmp_letter);
        letter.insert(letter.end(), digit.begin(), digit.end());
        
        return letter;
    }
};
```
