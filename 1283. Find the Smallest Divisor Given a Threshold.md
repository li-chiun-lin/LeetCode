Given an array of integers $nums$ and an integer $threshold$, we will choose a positive integer $divisor$, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the smallest $divisor$ such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to $threshold$.

Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: $7/3 = 3$ and $10/2 = 5$).

The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool check(vector<int>& nums, int threshold, int d)
    {
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int x : nums)
            sum += ceil((float)x / d);
        
        return sum <= threshold;
    }
public:
    int smallestDivisor(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
        int l = 1;
        int r = *max_element(begin(nums), end(nums)) + 1;
        int m = 0;
        
        while (l <= r)
        {
            m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            
            if (check(nums, threshold, m))
                r = m - 1;
            else
                l = m + 1;
        }
        
        return l;
    }
};
```
