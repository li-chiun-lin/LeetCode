You are given an unrooted weighted tree with $n$ vertices representing servers numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$, an array $edges$ where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i, weight_i]$ represents a bidirectional edge between vertices $a_i$ and $b_i$ of weight $weight_i$. You are also given an integer $signalSpeed$.

Two servers a and b are connectable through a server c if:

- $a < b, a \neq c$ and $b \neq c$.
- The distance from $c$ to $a$ is divisible by $signalSpeed$.
- The distance from $c$ to $b$ is divisible by $signalSpeed$.
- The path from $c$ to $b$ and the path from $c$ to $a$ do not share any edges.

Return an integer array $count$ of length $n$ where $count[i]$ is the number of server pairs that are connectable through the server $i$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countPairsOfConnectableServers(vector<vector<int>>& edges, int signalSpeed) {
        int n = size(edges) + 1;
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);
        vector<int> ans(n);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back({e[1], e[2]});
            adj[e[1]].push_back({e[0], e[2]});
        }

        function<int(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int u, int p, int l)
        {
            int ans = l % signalSpeed ? 0 : 1;

            for (auto [v, w] : adj[u])
                if (v != p)
                    ans += dfs(v, u, l + w);

            return ans;
        };
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            int cnt = 0;
            
            for (auto [u, w] : adj[i])
            {
                int l = dfs(u, i, w);
                ans[i] += cnt * l;
                cnt += l;
            }
        }
