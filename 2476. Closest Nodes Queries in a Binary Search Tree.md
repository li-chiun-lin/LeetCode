You are given the $root$ of a binary search tree and an array $queries$ of size $n$ consisting of positive integers.

Find a 2D array $answer$ of size $n$ where $answer[i] = [min_i, max_i]$:

- $min_i$ is the largest value in the tree that is smaller than or equal to $queries[i]$. If a such value does not exist, add $-1$ instead.
- $max_i$ is the smallest value in the tree that is greater than or equal to $queries[i]$. If a such value does not exist, add $-1$ instead.

Return the array answer.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> closestNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& queries) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        
        for (auto& q : queries)
        {
            TreeNode* ptr = root;
            int ub = -1;
            int lb = -1;
            
            while (ptr)
            {
                if (ptr->val < q)
                {
                    lb = ptr->val;
                    ptr = ptr->right;
                }
                else if (q < ptr->val)
                {
                    ub = ptr->val;
                    ptr = ptr->left;
                }
                else
                {
                    ub = q;
                    lb = q;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            ret.push_back({lb, ub});
        }
        
        return ret;
