We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly $1$.

Given an integer array $nums$, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLHS(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> hist;
        
        for (int n : nums)
            ++ hist[n];
        
        int ret = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        map<int, int>::const_iterator it = hist.begin();
        pair<int, int> prev = *it;
        
        while (++ it != hist.end())
        {
            if (it->first == prev.first + 1)
            {
                sum = it->second + prev.second;
                ret = max(ret, sum);
            }
            
            prev = *it;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
