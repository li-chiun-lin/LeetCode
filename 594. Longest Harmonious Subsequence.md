We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly $1$.

Given an integer array $nums$, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLHS(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Step 1: Build a frequency map for each number in the input array
        map<int, int> frequencyMap;
        for (int num : nums) {
            ++frequencyMap[num];
        }

        int maxLength = 0;

        // Step 2: Iterate through the frequency map to find adjacent number pairs
        for (auto it = frequencyMap.begin(); next(it) != frequencyMap.end(); ++it) {
            auto nextIt = next(it); // iterator to the next element

            // Check if current number and next number differ by exactly 1
            if (nextIt->first == it->first + 1) {
                int combinedLength = it->second + nextIt->second;
                maxLength = max(maxLength, combinedLength);
            }
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
};
```
