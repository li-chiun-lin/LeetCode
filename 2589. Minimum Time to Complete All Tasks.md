# Hard

There is a computer that can run an unlimited number of tasks at the same time. You are given a 2D integer array $tasks$ where $tasks[i] = [start_i, end_i, duration_i]$ indicates that the $i$-th task should run for a total of $duration_i$ seconds (not necessarily continuous) within the inclusive time range $[start_i, end_i]$.

You may turn on the computer only when it needs to run a task. You can also turn it off if it is idle.

Return the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinimumTime(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
        // all the possible computer slots
        vector<bool> running(2001);
        // counter of the number of slots that should be turn on
        int cnt = 0;

        // sort the tasks by their end time
        sort(begin(tasks), end(tasks), [](const auto &a, const auto &b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });

        for (auto& t : tasks)
        {
            int start = t[0];
            int end = t[1];
            int duration = t[2];

            // we count how many time slot between [start, end] that are already running,
            // since the computer can run an unlimited number of tasks at the same time.
            for (int i = start; i <= end && duration > 0; ++i)
                if (running[i])
                    -- duration;

            // if there are any duration left, we scan from `end' toward `start', 
            // whenever we encounter an idle slot, we turn it on.
            for (int i = end; duration > 0; --i)
            {
                if (! running[i])
                {
                    -- duration ;
                    running[i] = true;
                    ++ cnt;
                }
            }
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
```
