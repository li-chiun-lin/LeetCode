# Easy

There is a snake in an $n \times n$ matrix $grid$ and can move in four possible directions. Each cell in the grid is identified by the position: $grid[i][j] = (i \times n) + j$.

The snake starts at cell 0 and follows a sequence of commands.

You are given an integer $n$ representing the size of the $grid$ and an array of strings $commands$ where each $command[i]$ is either "UP", "RIGHT", "DOWN", and "LEFT". It's guaranteed that the snake will remain within the $grid$ boundaries throughout its movement.

Return the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after executing $commands$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int finalPositionOfSnake(int n, vector<string>& commands) {
        int pos = 0;
        
        for (auto& c : commands)
        {
            if (c == "UP")
                pos -= n;
            else if (c == "DOWN")
                pos += n;
            else if (c == "RIGHT")
                ++ pos;
            else
                -- pos;
        }
        
        return pos;
    }
};
```
