# Hard

There exists an undirected tree rooted at node $0$ with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree. You are also given a 0-indexed array $coins$ of size $n$ where $coins[i]$ indicates the number of coins in the vertex $i$, and an integer $k$.

Starting from the root, you have to collect all the coins such that the coins at a node can only be collected if the coins of its ancestors have been already collected.

Coins at nodei can be collected in one of the following ways:

- Collect all the coins, but you will get $coins[i] - k$ points. If $coins[i] - k$ is negative then you will lose $abs(coins[i] - k)$ points.
- Collect all the coins, but you will get $floor(coins[i] / 2)$ points. If this way is used, then for all the $node_j$ present in the subtree of $node_i$, $coins[j]$ will get reduced to $floor(coins[j] / 2)$.

Return the maximum points you can get after collecting the coins from all the tree nodes.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int dfs(int u, int p, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& coins, int k, int offset, vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        if (dp[u][offset] != INT_MIN)
            return dp[u][offset];
        
        int r1 = (coins[u] >> offset) - k;
        int r2 = coins[u] >> (offset + 1);
        
        for (int v : adj[u])
        {
            if (v == p)
                continue;
            
            r1 += dfs(v, u, adj, coins, k, offset, dp);
            r2 += dfs(v, u, adj, coins, k, min(offset + 1, 14), dp);
        }
        
        return dp[u][offset] = max(r1, r2);
    }
    
public:
    int maximumPoints(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& coins, int k) {
        int n = size(coins);
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(20, INT_MIN));
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        
        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        
        return dfs(0, -1, adj, coins, k, 0, dp);
    }
};
```
