You are given a binary array $nums$.

You can do the following operation on the array any number of times (possibly zero):

- Choose any 3 consecutive elements from the array and flip all of them.

Flipping an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in $nums$ equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = size(nums);
        
        for (int i = 0; i + 2 < n; ++i)
            if (nums[i] == 0)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j)
                    nums[i + j] = 1 - nums[i + j];
                
                ++ ans;
            }
        
        return nums[n - 2] == 0 || nums[n - 1] == 0 ? -1 : ans;
    }
};
```
