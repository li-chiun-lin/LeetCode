You are given a binary array $nums$.

You can do the following operation on the array any number of times (possibly zero):

- Choose any 3 consecutive elements from the array and flip all of them.

Flipping an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in $nums$ equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        int operationCount = 0;  // Stores the number of operations performed.
        int n = nums.size();     // Get the size of the input array.
        
        for (int i = 0; i + 2 < n; ++i) 
        {
            // If the current element is 0, flip this element and the next two elements.
            if (nums[i] == 0) 
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) 
                {
                    nums[i + j] = 1 - nums[i + j]; // Toggle 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.
                }
                
                ++operationCount; // Increment the operation count.
            }
        }
        
        // If any of the last two elements remain 0, return -1 (not possible to make all 1s).
        return (nums[n - 2] == 0 || nums[n - 1] == 0) ? -1 : operationCount;
    }
};
```
