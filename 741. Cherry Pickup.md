# Hard

You are given an $n \times n$ $grid$ representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

- $0$ means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
- $1$ means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
- $-1$ means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Return the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below:

- Starting at the position $(0, 0)$ and reaching $(n - 1, n - 1)$ by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value $0$ or $1$).
- After reaching $(n - 1, n - 1)$, returning to $(0, 0)$ by moving left or up through valid path cells.
- When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell $0$.
- If there is no valid path between $(0, 0)$ and $(n - 1, n - 1)$, then no cherries can be collected.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int cherryPickup(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int N = grid.size();
        int M = (N << 1) - 1;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(N, vector<int>(N));
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];

        for (int n = 1; n < M; ++n)
            for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i)
                for (int p = N - 1; p >= 0; --p)
                {
                    int j = n - i;
                    int q = n - p;

                    if (0 <= j && j < N && 0 <= q && q < N && grid[i][j] != -1 && grid[p][q] != -1)
                    {
                        if (0 <= i - 1)
                            dp[i][p] = max(dp[i][p], dp[i - 1][p]);

                        if (0 <= p - 1)
                            dp[i][p] = max(dp[i][p], dp[i][p - 1]);

                        if (0 <= i - 1 && 0 <= p - 1)
                            dp[i][p] = max(dp[i][p], dp[i - 1][p - 1]);

                        if (dp[i][p] != -1)
                            dp[i][p] += grid[i][j] + (i == p ? 0 : grid[p][q]);
                    }
                    else
                        dp[i][p] = -1;
                }

        return max(dp[N - 1][N - 1], 0);
    }
