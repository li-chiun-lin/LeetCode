A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either $0$ or $1$.

Given $quadTree1$ and $quadTree2$. $quadTree1$ represents a $n \times n$ binary matrix and $quadTree2$ represents another $n \times n$ binary matrix.

Return a Quad-Tree representing the $n \times n$ binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by $quadTree1$ and $quadTree2$.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to $true$ or $false$ when $isLeaf$ is $false$, and both are accepted in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

- $val$: $true$ if the node represents a grid of $1$'s or $false$ if the node represents a grid of $0$'s.
- $isLeaf$: $true$ if the node is leaf node on the tree or $false$ if the node has the four children.

```cpp
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

1. If the current grid has the same value, set $isLeaf$ $true$ and set $val$ to the value of the grid and set the four children to $null$ and stop.
1. If the current grid has different values, set $isLeaf$ to $false$ and set $val$ to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids.
1. Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

Quad-Tree format:

The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where $null$ signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list $[isLeaf, val]$.

If the value of $isLeaf$ or $val$ is $true$ we represent it as $1$ in the list $[isLeaf, val]$ and if the value of $isLeaf$ or $val$ is $false$ we represent it as $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* intersect(Node* q1, Node* q2) {
        if (q1->isLeaf)
            return q1->val ? q1 : q2;
        
        if (q2->isLeaf)
            return q2->val ? q2 : q1;
        
        auto tl = intersect(q1->topLeft, q2->topLeft);
        auto tr = intersect(q1->topRight, q2->topRight);
        auto bl = intersect(q1->bottomLeft, q2->bottomLeft);
        auto br = intersect(q1->bottomRight, q2->bottomRight);
            
        if (tl->isLeaf &&
            tr->isLeaf &&
            bl->isLeaf &&
            br->isLeaf &&
            tl->val == tr->val && 
            tl->val == bl->val && 
            tl->val == br->val)
            return new Node(tl->val, true);
        else
            return new Node(false, false, tl, tr, bl, br);
    }
};
```
