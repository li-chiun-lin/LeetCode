# Easy

In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return $true$ if and only if you can choose $X \geq 2$ such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

- Each group has exactly $X$ cards.
- All the cards in each group have the same integer.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasGroupsSizeX(vector<int>& deck) {
        map<int, int> hist;
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int d : deck)
            ++ hist[d];

        for (auto h : hist)
            ret = gcd(ret, h.second);
        
        return ret > 1;
    }
};
```
