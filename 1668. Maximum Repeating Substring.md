# Easy

For a string $sequence$, a string $word$ is $k$-repeating if $word$ concatenated $k$ times is a substring of $sequence$. The $word$'s maximum $k$-repeating value is the highest value $k$ where $word$ is $k$-repeating in $sequence$. If $word$ is not a substring of $sequence$, $word$'s maximum $k$-repeating value is $0$.

Given strings $sequence$ and $word$, return the maximum $k$-repeating value of $word$ in $sequence$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxRepeating(string sequence, string word) {
        int k = 0;
        string w = word;
        
        while (sequence.find(w) != string::npos)
        {
            ++ k;
            w += word;
        }
        
        return k;
    }
};
```
