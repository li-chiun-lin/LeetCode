# Hard

You are given an integer $n$. There is a complete binary tree with $2^n - 1$ nodes. The root of that tree is the node with the value $1$, and every node with a value $val$ in the range $[1, 2^{n - 1} - 1]$ has two children where:

- The left node has the value $2 * val$, and
- The right node has the value $2 * val + 1$.

You are also given a 2D integer array $queries$ of length $m$, where $queries[i] = [a_i, b_i]$. For each query, solve the following problem:

- Add an edge between the nodes with values $a_i$ and $b_i$.
- Find the length of the cycle in the graph.
- Remove the added edge between nodes with values $a_i$ and $b_i$.

Note that:

- A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is visited only once.
- The length of a cycle is the number of edges visited in the cycle.
- There could be multiple edges between two nodes in the tree after adding the edge of the query.

Return an array $answer$ of length $m$ where $answer[i]$ is the answer to the $i$-th query.
