# Medium

You have $n$ jobs and $m$ workers. You are given three arrays: $difficulty$, $profit$, and $worker$ where:

- $difficulty[i]$ and $profit[i]$ are the difficulty and the profit of the $i$-th job, and
- $worker[j]$ is the ability of $j$-th worker.

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfitAssignment(vector<int>& difficulty, vector<int>& profit, vector<int>& worker) {
        int n = difficulty.size();
        vector<pair<int, int>> dp(n);
        vector<int> best(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            dp[i] = {difficulty[i], profit[i]};
        
        sort(begin(dp), end(dp));

        best[0] = dp[0].second;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            best[i] = max(best[i - 1], dp[i].second);
        
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int w : worker)
            for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; --j)
                if (w >= dp[j].first)
                {
                    ret += best[j];
                    break;
                }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
