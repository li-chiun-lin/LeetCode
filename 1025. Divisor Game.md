# Easy

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number $n$ on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

- Choosing any $x$ with $0 < x < n$ and $n \mod x == 0$.
- Replacing the number $n$ on the chalkboard with $n - x$.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return $true$ if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool divisorGame(int n) {
        vector<bool> dp(n + 1);
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j * j <= i; ++j)
                if (i % j == 0 && ! dp[i - j])
                    dp[i] = true;
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
