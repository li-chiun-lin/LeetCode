# Easy

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ of size $3$ which can form the sides of a triangle.

- A triangle is called equilateral if it has all sides of equal length.
- A triangle is called isosceles if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
- A triangle is called scalene if all its sides are of different lengths.

Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or "none" if it cannot form a triangle.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string triangleType(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Step 1: Sort the side lengths in non-decreasing order
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // Step 2: Check if all three sides are equal
        if (nums[0] == nums[1] && nums[1] == nums[2]) {
            return "equilateral";
        }

        // Step 3: Check triangle inequality
        // The sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side
        if (nums[0] + nums[1] <= nums[2]) {
            return "none";  // Not a valid triangle
        }

        // Step 4: Check if at least two sides are equal
        if (nums[0] == nums[1] || nums[1] == nums[2]) {
            return "isosceles";
        }

        // Step 5: All sides are different and form a valid triangle
        return "scalene";
    }
};
