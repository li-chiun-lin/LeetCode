# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $nums$ and an integer $pivot$. Rearrange $nums$ such that the following conditions are satisfied:

- Every element less than $pivot$ appears before every element greater than $pivot$.
- Every element equal to $pivot$ appears in between the elements less than and greater than $pivot$.
- The relative order of the elements less than $pivot$ and the elements greater than $pivot$ is maintained.
  - More formally, consider every $p_i$, $p_j$ where $p_i$ is the new position of the $i$-th element and $p_j$ is the new position of the $j$-th element. If $i < j$ and both elements are smaller (or larger) than $pivot$, then $p_i < p_j$.

Return $nums$ after the rearrangement.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> pivotArray(vector<int>& nums, int pivot) {
        // Separate numbers into three categories: less than, equal to, and greater than pivot
        vector<int> left, mid, right;
        
        // Reserve memory to improve performance and avoid reallocations
        left.reserve(nums.size());
        mid.reserve(nums.size());
        right.reserve(nums.size());

        // Categorize elements based on their relation to the pivot
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < pivot) {
                left.push_back(num);
            } else if (num > pivot) {
                right.push_back(num);
            } else {
                mid.push_back(num);
            }
        }
        
        // Construct the final result by combining the three partitions
        left.insert(left.end(), make_move_iterator(mid.begin()), make_move_iterator(mid.end()));
        left.insert(left.end(), make_move_iterator(right.begin()), make_move_iterator(right.end()));

        return left;
    }
};
```
