# Medium

In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from $1$ to $10$. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a $total \geq 100$.

Given two integers $maxChoosableInteger$ and $desiredTotal$, return $true$ if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return $false$. Assume both players play optimally.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool next(int limit, int target, int select, vector<int> &dp)
    {
        if (target <= 0)
            return false;
        
        if (dp[select])
            return dp[select] == 1;
        
        for (int i = 1, bit = 1; i <= limit; ++i, bit <<= 1)
        {
            if ((bit & select) == 0 && ! next(limit, target - i, select | bit, dp))
            {
                dp[select] = 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        dp[select] = -1;
        return false;
    }
    
    bool canIWin(int maxChoosableInteger, int desiredTotal) {
        if (desiredTotal <= 0)
            return true;
        
        int sum = (1+maxChoosableInteger)*maxChoosableInteger/2;
        if(sum < desiredTotal) 
            return false;
        
        vector<int> dp(1 << maxChoosableInteger);
        
        return next(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal, 0, dp);
    }
};
```
