# Hard

There is a country of $n$ cities numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. In this country, there is a road connecting every pair of cities.

There are $m$ friends numbered from $0$ to $m - 1$ who are traveling through the country. Each one of them will take a path consisting of some cities. Each path is represented by an integer array that contains the visited cities in order. The path may contain a city more than once, but the same city will not be listed consecutively.

Given an integer $n$ and a 2D integer array $paths$ where $paths[i]$ is an integer array representing the path of the $i$-th friend, return the length of the longest common subpath that is shared by every friend's path, or $0$ if there is no common subpath at all.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubpath(int n, vector<vector<int>>& paths) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = min_element(begin(paths), end(paths), [](auto& a, auto& b)
        {
            return size(a) < size(b);
        })->size();
        long long base = 100001;
        long long mod = 100000000019;

        while (l < r)
        {
            int m = (l + r + 1) / 2;
            set<long long> s1;

            for (int i = 0; i < size(paths) && (i == 0 || size(s1)); ++i)
            {
                long long hash = 0;
                long long d = 1;
                set<long long> s2;

                for (int j = 0; j < size(paths[i]); ++j)
                {
                    hash = (hash * base + paths[i][j]) % mod;

                    if (j >= m)
                        hash = (mod + hash - d * paths[i][j - m] % mod) % mod;
                    else
                        d = d * base % mod;

                    if (j >= m - 1 && (i == 0 || s1.count(hash)))
                        s2.insert(hash);
                }

                swap(s1, s2);
            }

            if (s1.empty())
                r = m - 1;
            else
                l = m;
        }

        return l;
    }
};
```
