Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.

Given the positions of $houses$ and $heaters$ on a horizontal line, return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.

Notice that all the $heaters$ follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findRadius(vector<int>& houses, vector<int>& heaters) {
        sort(begin(heaters), end(heaters));
        int n = heaters.size();
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (auto h : houses)
        {
            auto it = lower_bound(begin(heaters), end(heaters), h);
            
            if (it == end(heaters))
                ret = max(ret, h - heaters[n - 1]);
            else if (it == begin(heaters))
                ret = max(ret, heaters[0] - h);
            else
            {
                auto lb = it - begin(heaters);
                ret = max(ret, min(heaters[lb] - h, h - heaters[lb - 1]));
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
