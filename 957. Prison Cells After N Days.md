# Medium

There are $8$ prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.

You are given an integer array $cells$ where $cells[i] == 1$ if the $i$-th cell is occupied and $cells[i] == 0$ if the $i$-th cell is vacant, and you are given an integer $n$.

Return the state of the prison after $n$ days (i.e., $n$ such changes described above).

        map<int, int> hit;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
        {
            prv = (prv << 1) | cells[i];
            mask[i] = 1 << (7 - i);
        }

                n %= m;
