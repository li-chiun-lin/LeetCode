You are given a binary string $binary$ consisting of only $0$'s or $1$'s. You can apply each of the following operations any number of times:

- Operation 1: If the number contains the substring "$00$", you can replace it with "$10$".
- Operation 2: If the number contains the substring "$10$", you can replace it with "$01$".

Return the maximum binary string you can obtain after any number of operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string maximumBinaryString(string binary) {
        int n = binary.size();
        int cnt0 = 0;
        int leftmost = -1;
        string ret(n, '1');
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
            if (binary[i] == '0')
            {
                ++ cnt0;
                leftmost = i;
            }
        
        // if there is no 0s, nothing to do.
        if (cnt0 == 0)
            return ret;
        
        // Using operation 2, we can move a 0 one step toward left.
        // Starting from the leftmost 0, 
        //   we try to move the next 0 to its right, making a 00 pattern,
        //   then we use operation 1 to change 00 -> 10, 
        //   so that we equivalently move the leftmost 0 one step toward right by consuming one addition 0.
        // So,
        //   our mission is indeed: move the leftmost 0 as far toward right as possible, 
        //   and if there are more 0s then needed, we can always remove unnecessary 0s by operation 1 one at a time.
        
        ret[min(leftmost + cnt0 - 1, n - 1)] = '0';
        return ret;
    }
};
