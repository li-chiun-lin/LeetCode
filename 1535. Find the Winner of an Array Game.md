# Medium

Given an integer array $arr$ of distinct integers and an integer $k$.

A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. $arr[0]$ and $arr[1]$). In each round of the game, we compare $arr[0]$ with $arr[1]$, the larger integer wins and remains at position $0$, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins $k$ consecutive rounds.

Return the integer which will win the game.

It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getWinner(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        
        if (k >= arr.size())
            return *max_element(begin(arr), end(arr));
        
        queue<int> que;
        
        for (int x : arr)
            que.push(x);
        
        int cnt = 0;
        int winner = que.front();
        que.pop();
        
        while (cnt < k)
        {
            int a = que.front();
            que.pop();
            
            if (a > winner)
            {
                que.push(winner);
                winner = a;
                cnt = 1;
            }
            else
            {
                que.push(a);
                ++ cnt;
            }
        }
        
        return winner;
    }
};
```
