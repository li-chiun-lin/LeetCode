# Medium

You are given two integer arrays, $technique1$ and $technique2$, each of length $n$, where $n$ represents the number of tasks to complete.

- If the $i$-th task is completed using technique 1, you earn $technique1[i]$ points.
- If it is completed using technique 2, you earn $technique2[i]$ points.

You are also given an integer $k$, representing the minimum number of tasks that must be completed using technique 1.

You must complete at least $k$ tasks using technique 1 (they do not need to be the first $k$ tasks).

The remaining tasks may be completed using either technique.

Return an integer denoting the maximum total points you can earn.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxPoints(vector<int>& technique1, vector<int>& technique2, int k) {
        int n = size(technique1);
        vector<tuple<int, int, int>> vec(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            vec[i] = {technique2[i] - technique1[i], technique2[i], technique1[i]};

        sort(begin(vec), end(vec));

        long long ans = 0;

        while (size(vec) > k)
        {
            auto [d, v2, v1] = vec.back();

            if (d >= 0)
                ans += v2;
            else
            {
                ans += v1;
                -- k;
            }

            vec.pop_back();
        }

        while (size(vec))
        {
            auto [d, v2, v1] = vec.back();
            
            ans += v1;
            vec.pop_back();
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
