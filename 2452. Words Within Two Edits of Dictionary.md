You are given two string arrays, $queries$ and $dictionary$. All words in each array comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.

In one edit you can take a word from $queries$, and change any letter in it to any other letter. Find all words from $queries$ that, after a maximum of two edits, equal some word from $dictionary$.

Return a list of all words from $queries$, that match with some word from $dictionary$ after a maximum of two edits. Return the words in the same order they appear in $queries$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> twoEditWords(vector<string>& queries, vector<string>& dictionary) {
        vector<string> ret;
        
        for (auto& q : queries)
            for (auto& d : dictionary)
            {
                int c = 0;
                
                for (int i = 0; i < q.size() && c <= 2; ++i)
                    if (q[i] != d[i])
                        ++ c;
                
                if (c <= 2)
                {
                    ret.push_back(q);
                    break;
                }
            }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
