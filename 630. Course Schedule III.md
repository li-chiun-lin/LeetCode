# Hard

There are $n$ different online courses numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are given an array $courses$ where $courses[i] = [duration_i, lastDay_i]$ indicate that the $i$-th course should be taken continuously for $duration_i$ days and must be finished before or on $lastDay_i$.

You will start on the 1st day and you cannot take two or more courses simultaneously.

Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.

```cpp

bool cmp(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b)
{
    return a[1] < b[1];
}

class Solution {
public:
    int scheduleCourse(vector<vector<int>>& courses) {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        int acc = 0;
        
        // sort by the deadline.
        sort(begin(courses), end(courses), cmp);
        
        for (auto &c : courses)
        {
            // if we still have enough time for this courses, take it.
            if (acc + c[0] <= c[1])
            {
                acc += c[0];
                pq.push(c[0]);
            }
            // or otherwise, we give up the course with longest duration from what we have taken
            // in this way we still take the same number of courses, but will lesser time.
            // this is the gready part.
            else
            {
                if (pq.size() && pq.top() > c[0])
                {
                    acc += c[0] - pq.top();
                    pq.pop();
                    pq.push(c[0]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return pq.size();
    }
};
