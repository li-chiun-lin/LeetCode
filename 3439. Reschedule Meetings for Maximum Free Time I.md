You are given an integer $eventTime$ denoting the duration of an event, where the event occurs from time $t = 0$ to time $t = eventTime$.

You are also given two integer arrays $startTime$ and $endTime$, each of length $n$. These represent the start and end time of $n$ non-overlapping meetings, where the $i$-th meeting occurs during the time $[startTime[i], endTime[i]]$.

You can reschedule at most $k$ meetings by moving their start time while maintaining the same duration, to maximize the longest continuous period of free time during the event.

The relative order of all the meetings should stay the same and they should remain non-overlapping.

Return the maximum amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.

```cpp
class Solution 
{
public:
    int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, int k, vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime) 
    {
        // Add the event time as the last element in the startTime array
        startTime.push_back(eventTime);

        int n = startTime.size();  // Get the updated size of startTime
        vector<int> prefix(n + 1); // Prefix sum array to track cumulative free time

        // Initialize the first free time interval
        prefix[1] = startTime[0];

        // Compute prefix sums of free time intervals
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) 
        {
            // The free time after `endTime[i-1]` is the time difference until `startTime[i]`
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + startTime[i] - endTime[i - 1];
        }

        int ans = 0;

        // Find the maximum free time interval over any `k+1` consecutive elements
        for (int i = k + 1; i <= n; ++i) 
        {
            // Calculate the free time over `k+1` events and maximize the result
            ans = max(ans, prefix[i] - prefix[i - k - 1]);
        }

        return ans; // Return the maximum free time found
    }
};
