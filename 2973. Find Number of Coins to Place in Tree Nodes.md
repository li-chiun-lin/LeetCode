# Hard

You are given an undirected tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$, and rooted at node $0$. You are given a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array $cost$ of length $n$, where $cost[i]$ is the cost assigned to the $i$-th node.

You need to place some coins on every node of the tree. The number of coins to be placed at node $i$ can be calculated as:

- If size of the subtree of node $i$ is less than $3$, place $1$ coin.
- Otherwise, place an amount of coins equal to the maximum product of cost values assigned to $3$ distinct nodes in the subtree of node $i$. If this product is negative, place $0$ coins.

Return an array $coin$ of size $n$ such that $coin[i]$ is the number of coins placed at node $i$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> placedCoins(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = size(cost);
        vector<long long> ans(n);
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        function<vector<long long>(int, int)> dfs = [&](int u, int p)
        {
            vector<long long> cc = {cost[u]};

            for (auto v : adj[u])
            {
                if (v == p)
                    continue;

                auto r = dfs(v, u);
                cc.insert(end(cc), begin(r), end(r));
            }

            sort(begin(cc), end(cc), greater<>());
            int m = size(cc);

            if (m < 3)
            {
                ans[u] = 1;
                return cc;
            }
            else
            {
                ans[u] = max(cc[0] * max(cc[1] * cc[2], cc[m - 1] * cc[m - 2]), 0LL);

                if (m <= 5)
                    return cc;
                else
                    return vector<long long>({cc[0], cc[1], cc[2], cc[m - 2], cc[m - 1]});
            }
        };

        dfs(0, -1);

        return ans;
    }
};
