# Medium

You are given a circle represented as $(radius, xCenter, yCenter)$ and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as $(x1, y1, x2, y2)$, where $(x1, y1)$ are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and $(x2, y2)$ are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.

Return $true$ if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return $false$. In other words, check if there is any point $(x_i, y_i)$ that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkOverlap(int radius, int xCenter, int yCenter, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        x1 -= xCenter;
        y1 -= yCenter;
        x2 -= xCenter;
        y2 -= yCenter;

        int mx = x1 * x2 > 0 ? min(x1 * x1, x2 * x2) : 0;
        int my = y1 * y2 > 0 ? min(y1 * y1, y2 * y2) : 0;

        return my + mx <= radius * radius;
    }
};
```
