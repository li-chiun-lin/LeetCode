Bob is stuck in a dungeon and must break n locks, each requiring some amount of energy to break. The required energy for each lock is stored in an array called $strength$ where $strength[i]$ indicates the energy needed to break the $i$-th lock.

To break a lock, Bob uses a sword with the following characteristics:

- The initial energy of the sword is $0$.
- The initial factor $X$ by which the energy of the sword increases is $1$.
- Every minute, the energy of the sword increases by the current factor $X$.
- To break the $i$-th lock, the energy of the sword must reach at least $strength[i]$.
- After breaking a lock, the energy of the sword resets to 0, and the factor $X$ increases by a given value $K$.

Your task is to determine the minimum time in minutes required for Bob to break all $n$ locks and escape the dungeon.

Return the minimum time required for Bob to break all $n$ locks.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Function to calculate the total time required to unlock all obstacles
    int unlock(vector<int>& strength, int K) {
        int totalTime = 0;   // Accumulator for total time
        int X = 1;           // Initial unlocking power

        // Calculate time for each obstacle based on current unlocking power
        for (double s : strength) {
            totalTime += (int)ceil(s / X);  // Required time for current obstacle
            X += K;  // Increase unlocking power by K after each obstacle
        }

        return totalTime;
    }

public:
    int findMinimumTime(vector<int>& strength, int K) {
        int minimumTime = INT_MAX;

        // Sort the strengths to prepare for permutations
        sort(begin(strength), end(strength));

        // Explore all permutations to find the minimum unlocking time
        do {
            minimumTime = min(minimumTime, unlock(strength, K));
        } while (next_permutation(begin(strength), end(strength)));

        return minimumTime;  // Return the minimum unlocking time found
    }
};
```
