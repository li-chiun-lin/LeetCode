# Hard

There are $n$ couples sitting in $2n$ seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.

The people and seats are represented by an integer array $row$ where $row[i]$ is the ID of the person sitting in the $i$-th seat. The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being $(0, 1)$, the second couple being $(2, 3)$, and so on with the last couple being $(2n - 2, 2n - 1)$.

Return the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwapsCouples(vector<int>& row) {
        int ret = 0;
        int n = row.size();
        vector<int> ptn(n), pos(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            ptn[i] = i + (i % 2 ? -1 : 1);
            pos[row[i]] = i;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = ptn[pos[ptn[row[i]]]]; i != j; j = ptn[pos[ptn[row[i]]]])
            {
                swap(row[i], row[j]);
                swap(pos[row[i]], pos[row[j]]);
                ++ ret;
            }
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
```
