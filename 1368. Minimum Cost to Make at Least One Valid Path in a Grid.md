# Hard

Given an $m \times n$ grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of $grid[i][j]$ can be:

- $1$ which means go to the cell to the right.
- $2$ which means go to the cell to the left.
- $3$ which means go to the lower cell.
- $4$ which means go to the upper cell.

Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.

You will initially start at the upper left cell $(0, 0)$. A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell $(0, 0)$ and ends at the bottom-right cell $(m - 1, n - 1)$ following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.

You can modify the sign on a cell with $cost = 1$. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.

Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.

        }

        return -1; // If no valid path exists, return -1 (should not occur in this problem)
