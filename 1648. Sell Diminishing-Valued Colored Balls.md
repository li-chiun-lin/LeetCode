You have an $inventory$ of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants $orders$ balls of any color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that color you currently have in your $inventory$.

You are given an integer array, $inventory$, where $inventory[i]$ represents the number of balls of the $i$-th color that you initially own. You are also given an integer $orders$, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls in any order.

Return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling $orders$ colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& inventory, int orders) {
        long long ans = 0;
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        long long l = 0;
        long long r = 1e9;
        map<int, int, greater<>> mp;

        auto check = [&](int m)
        {
            int t = orders;

            for (auto [k, v] : mp)
            {
                if (k <= m)
                    break;
                
                if ((t -= (long long)v * (k - m)) <= 0)
                    return true;
            }

            return t <= 0;
        };

        for (auto x : inventory)
            ++ mp[x];

        while (l <= r)
        {
            long long m = l + ( r - l) / 2;

            if (check(m))
                l = m + 1;
            else
                r = m - 1;
        }

        for (auto [k, v] : mp)
        {
            if (k <= l)
                break;

            orders -= (long long)v * (k - l);
            ans = (ans + (k + l + 1) * (k - l) / 2 % mod * v % mod) % mod;
        }

        ans = (ans + l * orders % mod) % mod;

        return ans;
    }
};
