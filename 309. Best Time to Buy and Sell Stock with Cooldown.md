You are given an array $prices$ where $prices[i]$ is the price of a given stock on the $i$-th day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like with the following restrictions:

- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rec(vector<int>& price, int d, bool buy, vector<vector<int>> &dp)
    {
        if (d >= price.size() )
            return 0;
        
        if (dp[d][buy])
            return dp[d][buy];
        
        int r1 = rec(price, d + 1, buy, dp);
        int r2 = 0;
        
        if (buy)
            r2 = - price[d] + rec(price, d + 1, ! buy, dp);
        else
            r2 = price[d] + rec(price, d + 2, ! buy, dp);
        
        dp[d][buy] = max(r1, r2);
        
        return dp[d][buy];
    }
    
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(2));
        
        return rec(prices, 0, true, dp);
 
    }
};
