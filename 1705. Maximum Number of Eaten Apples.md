There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for $n$ days. On the $i$-th day, the tree grows $apples[i]$ apples that will rot after $days[i]$ days, that is on day $i + days[i]$ the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by $apples[i] == 0$ and $days[i] == 0$.

You decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first $n$ days.

Given two integer arrays $days$ and $apples$ of length $n$, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.

public:
    int eatenApples(vector<int>& apples, vector<int>& days) {
        int n = apples.size();

        while (i < n)
        {
            // newly grow apples, don't put 0 apple in queue
            if (days[i] && apples[i])
                pq.push({i + days[i], apples[i]});
            
            // disgard rotten apples

                int n = min(d - i, a);
                
                eaten += n;
