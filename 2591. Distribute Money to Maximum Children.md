# Easy

You are given an integer $money$ denoting the amount of money (in dollars) that you have and another integer $children$ denoting the number of children that you must distribute the money to.

You have to distribute the money according to the following rules:

- All money must be distributed.
- Everyone must receive at least $1$ dollar.
- Nobody receives $4$ dollars.

Return the maximum number of children who may receive exactly $8$ dollars if you distribute the money according to the aforementioned rules. If there is no way to distribute the money, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distMoney(int money, int children) {
        money -= children;

        if (money < 0)
            return -1;

        int q = money / 7;
        int r = money % 7;

        if (q == children && r == 0)
            return q;

        if (q == children - 1 && r == 3)
            return q - 1;

        return min(children - 1, q);
    }
};
```
