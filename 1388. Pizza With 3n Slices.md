# Hard

There is a pizza with $3n$ slices of varying size, you and your friends will take slices of pizza as follows:

- You will pick any pizza slice.
- Your friend Alice will pick the next slice in the anti-clockwise direction of your pick.
- Your friend Bob will pick the next slice in the clockwise direction of your pick.
- Repeat until there are no more slices of pizzas.

Given an integer array $slices$ that represent the sizes of the pizza slices in a clockwise direction, return the maximum possible sum of slice sizes that you can pick.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSizeSlices(vector<int>& slices) {
        int m = size(slices);
        int n = m / 3;

        function<int(int)> calc = [&](int l)
        {
            vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1));

            for (int i = 2; i <= m; ++i)
                for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 2][j - 1] + slices[i - 1 - l]);

            return dp[m][n];
        };

        return max(calc(0), calc(1));
    }
};
```
