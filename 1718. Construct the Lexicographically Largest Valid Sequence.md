Given an integer $n$, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

- The integer $1$ occurs once in the sequence.
- Each integer between $2$ and $n$ occurs twice in the sequence.
- For every integer $i$ between $2$ and $n$, the distance between the two occurrences of $i$ is exactly $i$.

The distance between two numbers on the sequence, $a[i]$ and $a[j]$, is the absolute difference of their indices, $|j - i|$.

Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool backtrack(int index, vector<bool> &used, vector<int> &sequence) 
    {
        // Base case: if we reach the end, we have successfully constructed the sequence
        if (index == sequence.size())
            return true;
        
        // If current index is already filled, move to the next one
        if (sequence[index] != 0)
            return backtrack(index + 1, used, sequence);
        
        // Try placing numbers from n down to 2
        for (int num = used.size() - 1; num > 1; --num) 
        {
            // Conditions for skipping:
            // - The number is already used
            // - The second required position (index + num) is out of bounds
            // - The second required position is already occupied
            if (used[num] || index + num >= sequence.size() || sequence[index + num] != 0)
                continue;

            // Mark the number as used and place it in both positions
            used[num] = true;
            sequence[index] = num;
            sequence[index + num] = num;

            // Recur to fill the next index
            if (backtrack(index + 1, used, sequence))
                return true;

            // Undo the placement (backtracking)
            sequence[index] = 0;
            sequence[index + num] = 0;
            used[num] = false;
        }
        
        // Try placing the smallest number (1), which only occupies one position
        if (!used[1])

            used[1] = true;

            sequence[index] = 0;
            used[1] = false;
        }
        
        return false; // No valid placement found at this step
