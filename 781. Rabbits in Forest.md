# Medium

There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked $n$ rabbits "How many rabbits have the same color as you?" and collected the answers in an integer array $answers$ where $answers[i]$ is the answer of the $i$-th rabbit.

Given the array $answers$, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Calculates the minimum number of rabbits in the forest
    // based on the answers they give.
    int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
        map<int, int> frequency;  // Tracks how many rabbits gave each answer

        // Count the frequency of each answer
        for (int x : answers) {
            ++frequency[x];
        }

        int totalRabbits = 0;

        for (const auto& [groupSize, count] : frequency) {
            // groupSize: a rabbit says there are groupSize others like it
            // So total group size is groupSize + 1
            int fullGroupSize = groupSize + 1;

            // If we have 'count' rabbits reporting the same answer,
            // we need ceil(count / fullGroupSize) groups to account for them.
            int numGroups = (count + fullGroupSize - 1) / fullGroupSize;

            // Each group contributes 'fullGroupSize' rabbits
            totalRabbits += numGroups * fullGroupSize;
        }

        return totalRabbits;
    }
};
```
