# Medium

There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked $n$ rabbits "How many rabbits have the same color as you?" and collected the answers in an integer array $answers$ where $answers[i]$ is the answer of the $i$-th rabbit.

Given the array $answers$, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
        map<int, int> hit;
        
        for (int x : answers)
            ++ hit[x];
        
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (auto& h : hit)
            cnt += (h.first + h.second) / (h.first + 1) * (h.first + 1);
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
