Let's play the minesweeper game!

You are given an $m \times n$ char matrix $board$ representing the game board where:

- 'M' represents an unrevealed mine,
- 'E' represents an unrevealed empty square,
- 'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
- digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
- 'X' represents a revealed mine.

You are also given an integer array $click$ where $click = [click_r, click_c]$ represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E').

Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:

- If a mine 'M' is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to 'X'.
- If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank 'B' and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
- If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
- Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.
