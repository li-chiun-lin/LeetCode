# Easy

Alice and Bob are traveling to Rome for separate business meetings.

You are given 4 strings $arriveAlice$, $leaveAlice$, $arriveBob$, and $leaveBob$. Alice will be in the city from the dates $arriveAlice$ to $leaveAlice$ (inclusive), while Bob will be in the city from the dates $arriveBob$ to $leaveBob$ (inclusive). Each will be a 5-character string in the format **"MM-DD"**, corresponding to the month and day of the date.

Return the total number of days that Alice and Bob are in Rome together.

You can assume that all dates occur in the same calendar year, which is not a leap year. Note that the number of days per month can be represented as: $[31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int str2i(string& s)
    {
        int dom[] = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        
        int sm = (s[0] - '0') * 10 + s[1] - '0';
        int sd = (s[3] - '0') * 10 + s[4] - '0';
        
        int day = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < sm - 1; ++i)
            day += dom[i];
        
        return day + sd;
    }
public:
    int countDaysTogether(string arriveAlice, string leaveAlice, string arriveBob, string leaveBob) {
        string start = max(arriveAlice, arriveBob);
        string end = min(leaveAlice, leaveBob);
        
        return max(str2i(end) - str2i(start) + 1, 0);
    }
};
```
