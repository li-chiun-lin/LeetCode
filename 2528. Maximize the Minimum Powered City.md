# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $stations$ of length $n$, where $stations[i]$ represents the number of power stations in the $i$-th city.

Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by $r$, then a power station at city $i$ can provide power to all cities $j$ such that $|i - j| \leq r$ and $0 \leq i, j \leq n - 1$.

The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.

The government has sanctioned building $k$ more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.

Given the two integers $r$ and $k$, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxPower(vector<int>& stations, int r, int k) {
        int n = size(stations);
        long long sum = accumulate(begin(stations), begin(stations) + r, 0LL);

        auto check = [&](long long x)
        {
            vector<int> accu(n);
            int cnt = k;
            long long pow = sum;

            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            {
                if (i + r < n)
                    pow += stations[i + r];

                if (pow < x)
                {
                    long long dif = x - pow;

                    if (dif > cnt)
                        return false;

                    accu[min(n - 1, i + r)] += dif;
                    pow = x;
                    cnt -= dif;
                }

                if (i - r >= 0)
                    pow -= stations[i - r] + accu[i - r];
            }

            return true;
        };

        long long left = 0;
        long long right = accumulate(begin(stations), end(stations), 0LL) + k;
        long long ans = 0;

        while (left <= right)
        {
            long long mid = (left + right) / 2;

            if (check(mid))
            {
                ans = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }

        return ans;
