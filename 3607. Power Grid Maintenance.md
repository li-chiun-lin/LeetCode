You are given an integer $c$ representing $c$ power stations, each with a unique identifier $id$ from $1$ to $c$ (1‑based indexing).

These stations are interconnected via $n$ bidirectional cables, represented by a 2D array $connections$, where each element $connections[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates a connection between station $u_i$ and station $v_i$. Stations that are directly or indirectly connected form a power grid.

Initially, all stations are online (operational).

You are also given a 2D array $queries$, where each query is one of the following two types:

- $[1, x]$: A maintenance check is requested for station $x$. If station $x$ is online, it resolves the check by itself. If station $x$ is offline, the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest $id$ in the same power grid as $x$. If no operational station exists in that grid, return $-1$.

- $[2, x]$: Station $x$ goes offline (i.e., it becomes non-operational).

Return an array of integers representing the results of each query of type $[1, x]$ in the order they appear.

Note: The power grid preserves its structure; an offline (non‑operational) node remains part of its grid and taking it offline does not alter connectivity.
