# Medium

There is a party where **n** friends numbered from **0 to n - 1** are attending. There is an infinite number of chairs in this party that are numbered from **0 to infinity**. When a friend arrives at the party, they sit on the unoccupied chair with the smallest number.

- For example, if chairs **0,** **1**, and **5** are occupied when a friend comes, they will sit on chair number **2**.

When a friend leaves the party, their chair becomes unoccupied at the moment they leave. If another friend arrives at that same moment, they can sit in that chair.

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array **times** where **times[i] = [arrival<sub>i</sub>, leaving<sub>i</sub>]**, indicating the arrival and leaving times of the **i**-th friend respectively, and an integer **targetFriend**. All arrival times are distinct.

Return the **chair number** that the friend numbered **targetFriend** will sit on.
