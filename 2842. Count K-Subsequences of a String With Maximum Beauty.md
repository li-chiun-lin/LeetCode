# Hard

You are given a string $s$ and an integer $k$.

A $k$-subsequence is a subsequence of $s$, having length $k$, and all its characters are unique, i.e., every character occurs once.

Let $f(c)$ denote the number of times the character $c$ occurs in $s$.

The beauty of a $k$-subsequence is the sum of $f(c)$ for every character $c$ in the $k$-subsequence.

Return an integer denoting the number of $k$-subsequences whose beauty is the maximum among all $k$-subsequences. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

Notes

- $f(c)$ is the number of times a character $c$ occurs in $s$, not a $k$-subsequence.
- Two $k$-subsequences are considered different if one is formed by an index that is not present in the other. So, two $k$-subsequences may form the same string.

```cpp
class Solution {
    
public:
    int countKSubsequencesWithMaxBeauty(string s, int k) {
        long long ret = 1;
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<int> f(26);
        
        for (char c : s)
            ++ f[c - 'a'];
        
        vector<int> vec;
        
        nth_element(begin(f), begin(f) + 26 - k, end(f));

        if (k > 26 || f[26 - k] == 0)
            return 0;

        long long cmb = 1, lb = f[26 - k], pend = 0;

        for (int x : f)
        {
            if (x > lb)
            {
                -- k;
                ret = ret * x % m;
            }
            else if (x == lb)
            {
                ++ pend;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
        {
            cmb = cmb * (pend - i) / (i + 1);
            ret = ret * lb % m;
        }
        
        return ret * cmb % m;
    }
};
