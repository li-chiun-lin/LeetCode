# Hard

An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

- 'A': Absent.
- 'L': Late.
- 'P': Present.

Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

- The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
- The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.

Given an integer $n$, return the number of possible attendance records of length $n$ that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int checkRecord(int n) {
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<long long> A(n), P(n), L(n);

        if (n == 1)
            return 3;

        if (n == 2)
            return 8;

        P[0] = 1;
        L[0] = 1;
        L[1] = 3;
        A[0] = 1;
        A[1] = 2;
        A[2] = 4;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            P[i] = (A[i - 1] + P[i - 1] + L[i - 1]) % m;

            if (i > 1)
                L[i] = (A[i - 1] + P[i - 1] + A[i - 2] + P[i - 2]) % m;

            if (i > 2)
                A[i] = (A[i - 1] + A[i - 2] + A[i - 3]) % m;
        }

        return (A[n - 1] + P[n - 1] + L[n - 1]) % m;
        
    }
};
