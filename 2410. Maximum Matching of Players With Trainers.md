# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $players$, where $players[i]$ represents the ability of the $i$-th player. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array $trainers$, where $trainers[j]$ represents the training capacity of the $j$-th trainer.

The $i$-th player can match with the $j$-th trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's training capacity. Additionally, the $i$-th player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the $j$-th trainer can be matched with at most one player.

Return the maximum number of matchings between $players$ and $trainers$ that satisfy these conditions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int matchPlayersAndTrainers(vector<int>& players, vector<int>& trainers) {
        // Sort both arrays in ascending order
        sort(begin(players), end(players));
        sort(begin(trainers), end(trainers));
        
        int i = players.size() - 1;   // Pointer to the strongest remaining player
        int j = trainers.size() - 1;  // Pointer to the strongest remaining trainer
        int matches = 0;

        // Try to match the strongest players with the strongest trainers
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
                // Trainer j can train player i
                matches++;
                j--; // Move to the next strongest trainer
            }
            // Whether matched or not, move to the next player
            i--;
        }

        return matches;
    }
};
