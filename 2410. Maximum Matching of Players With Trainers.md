# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed integer array $players$, where $players[i]$ represents the ability of the $i$-th player. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array $trainers$, where $trainers[j]$ represents the training capacity of the $j$-th trainer.

The $i$-th player can match with the $j$-th trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's training capacity. Additionally, the $i$-th player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the $j$-th trainer can be matched with at most one player.

Return the maximum number of matchings between $players$ and $trainers$ that satisfy these conditions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int matchPlayersAndTrainers(vector<int>& players, vector<int>& trainers) {
        int m = players.size();
        int n = trainers.size();
        
        sort(begin(players), end(players));
        sort(begin(trainers), end(trainers));
        
        int j = n - 1;
        
        // for every player, start from the one with highest ability toward those with lower abilities,
        // if a player can be trained by a trainer, also in descending order, then train him/her.
        // if there is no trainers can train the player, abandon the this player and try next player with lower ability.
        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0 && j >= 0; --i)
            if (players[i] <= trainers[j])
                --j;
        
        return n - 1 - j;
    }
};
