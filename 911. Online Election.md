You are given two integer arrays $persons$ and $times$. In an election, the $i$-th vote was cast for $persons[i]$ at time $times[i]$.

For each query at a time $t$, find the person that was leading the election at time $t$. Votes cast at time $t$ will count towards our query. In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

Implement the __TopVotedCandidate__ class:

- __TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times)__ Initializes the object with the $persons$ and $times$ arrays.
- __int q(int t)__ Returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time $t$ according to the mentioned rules.

```cpp
class TopVotedCandidate {
    map<int, int> mp;

public:
    TopVotedCandidate(vector<int>& persons, vector<int>& times) {
        int n = size(persons);
        int lead = -1;
        map<int, int> cnt;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            lead = ++ cnt[persons[i]] >= cnt[lead] ? persons[i] : lead;
            mp[times[i]] = lead;
        }
    }
    
    int q(int t) {
        return prev(mp.upper_bound(t))->second;
    }
};
```
