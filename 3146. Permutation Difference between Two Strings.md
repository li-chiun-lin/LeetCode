# Easy

You are given two strings $s$ and $t$ such that every character occurs at most once in $s$ and $t$ is a permutation of $s$.

The permutation difference between $s$ and $t$ is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each character in $s$ and the index of the occurrence of the same character in $t$.

Return the permutation difference between $s$ and $t$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPermutationDifference(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> idx(26);
        int n = size(s);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            idx[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
        
        int ans = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ans += abs(idx[t[i] - 'a'] - i);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
