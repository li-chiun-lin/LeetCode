# Hard

You are given an integer array $target$. You have an integer array $initial$ of the same size as $target$ with all elements initially zeros.

In one operation you can choose any subarray from $initial$ and increment each value by one.

Return the minimum number of operations to form a $target$ array from $initial$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOperations(vector<int>& target) {
        int ans = target[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < size(target); ++i)
            ans += max(target[i] - target[i - 1], 0);

        return ans;
    }
};
```
