A digit string is good if the digits (0-indexed) at even indices are even and the digits at odd indices are prime ($2, 3, 5$, or $7$).

Given an integer $n$, return the total number of good digit strings of length $n$. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodNumbers(long long n) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        // If n is odd, we have one extra even-positioned digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), i.e., 5 choices.
        // If n is even, we don't multiply by 5.
        long long remaining = (n % 2 == 1) ? 5 : 1;

        // Number of choices for each pair (even + odd position): 5 (even) * 4 (prime) = 20
        long long base = 20;
        long long result = 1;

        // Half of the digits contribute one even and one odd position
        n >>= 1;

        // Fast exponentiation: compute base^n % MOD
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n & 1)
                result = (result * base) % MOD;

            base = (base * base) % MOD;
            n >>= 1;
        }

        // Multiply by 5 if n was odd (i.e., we had one extra even-position digit)
        return (result * remaining) % MOD;
    }
};
```
