A digit string is good if the digits (0-indexed) at even indices are even and the digits at odd indices are prime (**2, 3, 5**, or **7**).

- For example, "**2582**" is good because the digits (**2** and **8**) at even positions are even and the digits (**5** and **2**) at odd positions are prime. However, "**3245**" is not good because **3** is at an even index but is not even.

Given an integer **n**, return the total number of good digit strings of length **n**. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo **10<sup>9</sup> + 7**.

A digit string is a string consisting of digits **0** through **9** that may contain leading zeros.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodNumbers(long long n) {
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        long long r = (n % 2) ? 5 : 1;
        long long b = 20;
        long long a = 1;
        
        n >>= 1;
        
        while (n)
        {
            if (n & 1)
                a = (a * b) % m;
            
            b = (b * b) % m;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        
        return (a * r) % m;
    }
};
```
