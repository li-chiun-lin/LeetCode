# Easy

You are given a string **s** consisting only of the characters **'0'** and **'1'**. In one operation, you can change any **'0'** to **'1'** or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string **"010"** is alternating, while the string **"0100"** is not.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make **s** alternating.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(string s) {
        // we have two choices, 
        // case 1: make s 0101010101010 ...
        // case 2: make s 1010101010101 ...
        int c1 = 0;
        int c2 = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
        {
            // if we have to change s[i] to reach a final result as case 1.
            if (s[i] - '0' != i % 2)
                ++ c1;
            
            // if we have to change s[i] to reach a final result as case 2.
            if (s[i] - '0' != 1 - (i % 2))
                ++ c2;
        }
        
        return min(c1, c2);
    }
};
```
