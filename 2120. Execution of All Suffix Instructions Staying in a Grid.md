# Medium

There is an **n x n** grid, with the top-left cell at **(0, 0)** and the bottom-right cell at **(n - 1, n - 1)**. You are given the integer **n** and an integer array **startPos** where **startPos = [startrow, startcol]** indicates that a robot is initially at cell **(startrow, startcol)**.

You are also given a 0-indexed string **s** of length **m** where **s[i]** is the **i**-th instruction for the robot: 'L' (move left), 'R' (move right), 'U' (move up), and 'D' (move down).

The robot can begin executing from any **i**-th instruction in **s**. It executes the instructions one by one towards the end of **s** but it stops if either of these conditions is met:

- The next instruction will move the robot off the grid.
- There are no more instructions left to execute.

Return an array **answer** of length **m** where **answer[i]** is the number of instructions the robot can execute if the robot begins executing from the **i**-th instruction in **s**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> executeInstructions(int n, vector<int>& startPos, string s) {
        int m = s.size();
        vector<int> ret(m);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        {
            int x = startPos[0];
            int y = startPos[1];
            int j = i;
            int c = 0;
            
            while (j < m)
            {
                if (s[j] == 'U')
                    x -= 1;
                else if (s[j] == 'D')
                    x += 1;
                else if (s[j] == 'L')
                    y -= 1;
                else
                    y += 1;
                
                if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= n || y >= n)
                    break;
                
                ++ j;
                ++ c;
            }
            
            ret[i] = c;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
