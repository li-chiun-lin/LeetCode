# Easy

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.

You are given a string $word$, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int possibleStringCount(string word) {
        int ans = 1;
        int cnt = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < size(word); ++i)
        {
            if (word[i - 1] == word[i])
            {
                ++ cnt;
            }
            else
            {
                ans += cnt - 1;
                cnt = 1;
            }
        }

        ans += cnt - 1;

        return ans;
    }
};
```
