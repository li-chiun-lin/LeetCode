# Easy

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.

You are given a string $word$, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // This function counts the number of ways to delete characters
    // from a string so that no two adjacent characters are equal.
    int possibleStringCount(string word) {
        int totalWays = 1;  // Start with the original string (no deletions)
        int repeatCount = 1;  // Count of consecutive repeated characters

        // Iterate through the string to find adjacent duplicates
        for (int i = 1; i < word.size(); ++i) {
            if (word[i] == word[i - 1]) {
                ++repeatCount;  // Current character is same as previous
            } else {
                // For each group of repeated characters, we can remove (group size - 1)
                totalWays += repeatCount - 1;
                repeatCount = 1;  // Reset for the next group
            }
        }

        // Add the last group (if the string ended with duplicates)
        totalWays += repeatCount - 1;

        return totalWays;
    }
};
```
