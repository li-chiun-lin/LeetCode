# Medium

You are given an integer array $coins$ of length $n$ which represents the $n$ coins that you own. The value of the $i$-th coin is $coins[i]$. You can make some value $x$ if you can choose some of your $n$ coins such that their values sum up to $x$.

Return the maximum number of consecutive integer values that you can make with your coins starting from and including $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMaximumConsecutive(vector<int>& coins) {
        sort(begin(coins), end(coins));
        int ans = 1;

        for (auto x : coins)
        {
            if (x > ans)
                break;

            ans += x;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
