# Hard

You are given two integer arrays, $nums$ and $forbidden$, each of length $n$.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Choose two distinct indices $i$ and $j$, and swap $nums[i]$ with $nums[j]$.

Return the minimum number of swaps required such that, for every index $i$, the value of $nums[i]$ is not equal to $forbidden[i]$. If no amount of swaps can ensure that every index avoids its forbidden value, return $-1$.
