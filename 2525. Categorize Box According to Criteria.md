# Easy

Given four integers $length$, $width$, $height$, and $mass$, representing the dimensions and mass of a box, respectively, return a string representing the category of the box.

- The box is "Bulky" if:
  - Any of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to $10^4$.
  - Or, the volume of the box is greater or equal to $10^9$.
- If the mass of the box is greater or equal to $100$, it is "Heavy".
- If the box is both "Bulky" and "Heavy", then its category is "Both".
- If the box is neither "Bulky" nor "Heavy", then its category is "Neither".
- If the box is "Bulky" but not "Heavy", then its category is "Bulky".
- If the box is "Heavy" but not "Bulky", then its category is "Heavy".

Note that the volume of the box is the product of its length, width and height.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string categorizeBox(int length, int width, int height, int mass) {
        int c4 = 1e4;
        int c9 = 1e9;
        int flag = 0;

        if (length >= c4 || width >= c4 || height >= c4 || (long long)length * width * height >= c9)
            flag |= 0x01;
        
        if (mass >= 100)
            flag |= 0x02;

        if ((flag & 0x01) && (flag & 0x02))
            return "Both";

        if (flag & 0x01)
            return "Bulky";

        if (flag & 0x02)
            return "Heavy";

        return "Neither";
    }
};
```
