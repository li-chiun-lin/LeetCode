# Easy

Given a non-empty array of integers $nums$, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (int x : nums)
            ret ^= x;
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
