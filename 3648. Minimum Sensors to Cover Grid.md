You are given $n \times m$ grid and an integer $k$.

A sensor placed on cell $(r, c)$ covers all cells whose Chebyshev distance from $(r, c)$ is at most $k$.

The Chebyshev distance between two cells $(r_1, c_1)$ and $(r_2, c_2)$ is $\max(|r_1 − r_2|,|c_1 − c_2|)$.

Your task is to return the minimum number of sensors required to cover every cell of the grid.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate the minimum number of sensors needed to cover an n by m grid
    // with each sensor covering a range defined by k.
    int minSensors(int n, int m, int k) {
        // Compute the number of sensors needed horizontally (width m):
        // Each sensor covers (2*k + 1) units, so divide m by that range and round up.
        int h = ceil((double)m / (2 * k + 1));

        // Compute the number of sensors needed vertically (height n),
        // following the same logic as horizontal coverage.
        int v = ceil((double)n / (2 * k + 1));

        // Return the total sensors needed (product of horizontal and vertical counts).
        return h * v;
    }
};
```
