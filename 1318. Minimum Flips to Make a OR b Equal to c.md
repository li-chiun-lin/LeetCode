Given 3 positives numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of $a$ and $b$ to make ($a$ OR $b == c$).

Flip operation consists of change any single bit $1$ to $0$ or change the bit $0$ to $1$ in their binary representation.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
        int cnt = 0;
        
        while (a || b || c)
        {
            int a1 = a & 1;
            int b1 = b & 1;
            int c1 = c & 1;
            
            if (c1 != (a1 | b1))
            {
                if (c1 == 1)
                {
                    // flip either a or b will do.
                    ++ cnt;
                }
                else
                {
                    // flip those pop bits of a and b.
                    cnt += a1 + b1;
                }
            }
            
            a >>= 1;
            b >>= 1;
            c >>= 1;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
