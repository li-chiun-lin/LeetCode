# Medium

We are given an array $asteroids$ of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> asteroidCollision(vector<int>& asteroids) {
        vector<int> ret;
        
        // scan from left to right
        for (int a : asteroids)
        {
            // if it is going toward right, good, we take it.
            if (a > 0)
            {
                ret.push_back(a);
            }
            // if it is going toward left, oops, prepare for impact
            else
            {
                // for those smaller asteroids that are going toward right,
                // they explode.
                while (ret.size() && ret.back() > 0 && ret.back() < -a)
                    ret.pop_back();
                
                // if there is a asteroid going toward right which happens to have the same size,
                // they both explode.
                if (ret.size() && ret.back() > 0 && ret.back() == -a)
                {
                    ret.pop_back();
                }
                // if there is a asteroid going toward right that is bigger,
                // it will survive and the left going asteroid explode
                else if (ret.size() && ret.back() > 0)
                {
                    
                }
                // if there is no more right going asteroid, we accept the left going asteroid.
                else
                {
                    ret.push_back(a);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
