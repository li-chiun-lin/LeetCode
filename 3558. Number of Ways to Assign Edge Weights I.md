There is an undirected tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $1$ to $n$, rooted at node $1$. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i$] indicates that there is an edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$.

Initially, all edges have a weight of $0$. You must assign each edge a weight of either $1$ or $2$.

The cost of a path between any two nodes $u$ and $v$ is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

Select any one node $x$ at the maximum depth. Return the number of ways to assign edge weights in the path from node $1$ to $x$ such that its total cost is odd.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Recursive function to compute the depth of the tree rooted at `u`
    // `p` is the parent node to avoid revisiting it
    int computeDepth(const vector<vector<int>>& adj, int parent, int node) {
        int maxDepth = 0;

        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (neighbor != parent) {
                maxDepth = max(maxDepth, computeDepth(adj, node, neighbor));
            }
        }

        return maxDepth + 1;
    }

public:
    int assignEdgeWeights(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size() + 1;               // Number of nodes
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;                // Modulo for final answer

        // Build the adjacency list
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);         // Using 1-based indexing

        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u);
        }

        // Compute the depth of the tree starting from node 1
        int treeDepth = computeDepth(adj, 0, 1);

        // The answer is 2^(depth - 2) % MOD
        // The `-2` accounts for reducing the path to exclude root and leaf
        treeDepth -= 2;
        long long result = 1;

        while (treeDepth-- > 0) {
            result = result * 2 % MOD;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
