# Easy

You are given an $m \times n$ matrix $grid$ consisting of positive integers.

Perform the following operation until $grid$ becomes empty:

- Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.
- Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.

Note that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.

Return the answer after performing the operations described above.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int deleteGreatestValue(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int ret = 0;
        
        for (auto& r : grid)
            sort(begin(r), end(r));
        
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; --j)
        {
            int x = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
                x = max(x, grid[i][j]);
            
            ret += x;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
