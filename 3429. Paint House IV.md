You are given an even integer $n$ representing the number of houses arranged in a straight line, and a 2D array $cost$ of size $n \times 3$, where $cost[i][j]$ represents the cost of painting house $i$ with color $j + 1$.

The houses will look beautiful if they satisfy the following conditions:

- No two adjacent houses are painted the same color.
- Houses equidistant from the ends of the row are not painted the same color.

Return the minimum cost to paint the houses such that they look beautiful.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Constant representing infinity for initial states.
    const long long INF = 1e16;

    // Recursive function to calculate the minimum cost
    long long calculateMinCost(int start, int end, int firstColor, int secondColor, vector<vector<int>>& costMatrix, vector<vector<vector<long long>>>& dp) {
        // Base case: If the start index exceeds the end, return 0
        if (start > end) 
            return 0;

        // If the result for this state has already been computed, return it.
        if (dp[start][firstColor][secondColor] != INF) 
            return dp[start][firstColor][secondColor];

        // Initialize the minimum cost to infinity
        long long minCost = INF;

        // Iterate over all possible colors for the first and second parts
        for (int color1 = 0; color1 < 3; ++color1) 
        {
            for (int color2 = 0; color2 < 3; ++color2) 
            {
                // Skip if both colors are the same, or if one is chosen for both parts
                if (color1 == firstColor || color2 == secondColor || color1 == color2) 
                    continue;

                long long currentCost = calculateMinCost(start + 1, end - 1, color1, color2, costMatrix, dp) 
                                        + costMatrix[start][color1] // Cost for painting the `start` index with `color1`
                                        + costMatrix[end][color2];   // Cost for painting the `end` index with `color2`

                // Update the minimum cost if a better one is found
                minCost = min(minCost, currentCost);
            }
        }

        // Memoize the result and return it
        return dp[start][firstColor][secondColor] = minCost;
    }

public:
    // Function to find the minimum cost to paint the houses
    long long minCost(int n, vector<vector<int>>& costMatrix) {

            vector<vector<long long>>(4, 
            vector<long long>(4, INF)));
