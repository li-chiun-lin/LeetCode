# Medium

Given a string $s$, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.

Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int partitionString(string s) {
        int cnt = 1;
        int status = 0;
        
        for (char c : s)
        {
            if (status & (1 << (c - 'a')))
            {
                ++ cnt;
                status = 1 << (c - 'a');
            }
            
            status |= (1 << (c - 'a'));
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
