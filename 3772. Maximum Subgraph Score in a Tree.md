# Hard

You are given an undirected tree with $n$ nodes, numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. It is represented by a 2D integer array $edges​​​​​​​$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $a_i$ and $b_i$ in the tree.

You are also given an integer array $good$ of length $n$, where $good[i]$ is $1$ if the $i$-th node is good, and $0$ if it is bad.

Define the score of a subgraph as the number of good nodes minus the number of bad nodes in that subgraph.

For each node $i$, find the maximum possible score among all connected subgraphs that contain node $i$.

Return an array of $n$ integers where the $i$-th element is the maximum score for node $i$.
