Given an integer array $nums$ of length $n$ where all the integers of $nums$ are in the range $[1, n]$ and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ time and uses only constant extra space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ret;
        
        for (int i : nums)
        {
            int a = abs(i);
            
            if (nums[a - 1] < 0)
                ret.push_back(a);
            else
                nums[a - 1] *= -1;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
