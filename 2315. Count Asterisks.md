# Easy

You are given a string $s$, where every two consecutive vertical bars **'|'** are grouped into a pair. In other words, the 1st and 2nd **'|'** make a pair, the 3rd and 4th **'|'** make a pair, and so forth.

Return the number of **'*'** in $s$, excluding the **'*'** between each pair of **'|'**.

Note that each **'|'** will belong to exactly one pair.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countAsterisks(string s) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int okay = 1;
        
        for (char c : s)
        {
            if (c == '|')
                okay = 1 - okay;
            else if (c == '*')
                cnt += okay;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
