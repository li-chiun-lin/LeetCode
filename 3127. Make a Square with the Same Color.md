# Easy

You are given a 2D matrix $grid$ of size $3 \times 3$ consisting only of characters 'B' and 'W'. Character 'W' represents the white color, and character 'B' represents the black color.

Your task is to change the color of at most one cell so that the matrix has a $2 \times 2$ square where all cells are of the same color.

Return $true$ if it is possible to create a $2 \times 2$ square of the same color, otherwise, return $false$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMakeSquare(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < 2; ++j)
            {
                int cnt = 0;
                
                for (int ii = 0; ii < 2; ++ii)
                    for (int jj = 0; jj < 2; ++jj)
                        if (grid[i + ii][j + jj] == 'B')
                            ++ cnt;
                
                if (cnt != 2)
                    return true;
            }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
