# Easy

There are **n** seats and **n** students in a room. You are given an array **seats** of length **n**, where **seats[i]** is the position of the **i**-th seat. You are also given the array **students** of length **n**, where **students[j]** is the position of the **j**-th student.

You may perform the following move any number of times:

- Increase or decrease the position of the **i**-th student by **1** (i.e., moving the **i**-th student from position **x** to **x + 1** or **x - 1**)

Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.

Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToSeat(vector<int>& seats, vector<int>& students) {
        int cnt = 0;
        sort(seats.begin(), seats.end());
        sort(students.begin(), students.end());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); ++i)
            cnt += abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
