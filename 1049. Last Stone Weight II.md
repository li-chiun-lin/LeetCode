# Medium

You are given an array of integers $stone$ where $stones[i]$ is the weight of the $i$-th stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights $x$ and $y$ with $x \leq y$. The result of this smash is:

- If $x == y$, both stones are destroyed, and
- If $x \neq y$, the stone of weight $x$ is destroyed, and the stone of weight $y$ has new weight $y - x$.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return $0$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeightII(vector<int>& stones) {
        set<int> s1 = {0};

        for (auto x : stones)
        {
            set<int> s2;

            for (auto y : s1)
            {
                s2.insert(y - x);
                s2.insert(y + x);
            }

            swap(s1, s2);
        }

        return abs(*min_element(begin(s1), end(s1), [](int a, int b)
        {
            return abs(a) < abs(b);
        }));
    }
};
```
