You are given a positive integer 0-indexed array $nums$.

A subset of the array $nums$ is square-free if the product of its elements is a square-free integer.

A square-free integer is an integer that is divisible by no square number other than $1$.

Return the number of square-free non-empty subsets of the array $nums$. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

A non-empty subset of $nums$ is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none but not all) elements from $nums$. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.
