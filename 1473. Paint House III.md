# Hard

There is a row of $m$ houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the $n$ colors (labeled from $1$ to $n$), some houses that have been painted last summer should not be painted again.

A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.

Given an array $houses$, an $m \times n$ matrix $cost$ and an integer $target$ where:

- $houses[i]$: is the color of the house $i$, and $0$ if the house is not painted yet.
- $cost[i][j]$: is the cost of paint the house $i$ with the color $j + 1$.

Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly $target$ neighborhoods. If it is not possible, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int FAIL = 10000001;
    
    int dfs(vector<int>& houses, vector<vector<int>>& cost, int target, int i, int neighbor, int color, vector<vector<vector<int>>> &dp)
    {
        if (i == houses.size())
            return neighbor == target ? 0 : FAIL;
        
        if (neighbor > target)
            return FAIL;
        
        if (dp[i][color][neighbor])
            return dp[i][color][neighbor];
        
        int ret = FAIL;
        
        if (houses[i])
        {
            ret = dfs(houses, cost, target, i + 1, neighbor + (houses[i] != color), houses[i], dp);
        }
        else
        {
            for (int j = 1; j <= cost[0].size(); ++j)
            {
                int r = dfs(houses, cost, target, i + 1, neighbor + (j != color), j, dp) + cost[i][j - 1];
                ret = min(ret, r);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[i][color][neighbor] = ret;
    }
    
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& houses, vector<vector<int>>& cost, int m, int n, int target) {
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(m, vector<vector<int>>(n + 1, vector<int>(target + 1)));
        
        int ret = dfs(houses, cost, target, 0, 0, 0, dp);
        
        return ret == FAIL ? -1 : ret;
    }
};
