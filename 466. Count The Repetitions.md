# Hard

We define $str = [s, n]$ as the string $str$ which consists of the string $s$ concatenated $n$ times.

We define that string $s1$ can be obtained from string $s2$ if we can remove some characters from $s2$ such that it becomes $s1$.

You are given two strings $s1$ and $s2$ and two integers $n1$ and $n2$. You have the two strings $str1 = [s1, n1]$ and $str2 = [s2, n2]$.

Return the maximum integer $m$ such that $str = [str2, m]$ can be obtained from $str1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMaxRepetitions(string s1, int n1, string s2, int n2) {
        int j = 0;
        int c2 = 0;

        for (int c1 = 0; c1 < n1; ++c1)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); ++i)
            {
                if (s1[i] == s2[j])
                {
                    if (++ j == s2.size())
                    {
                        j = 0;
                        ++ c2;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (j == 0)
                return n1 * c2 / ((c1 + 1) * n2);
        }

        return c2 / n2;
    }
};
