# Hard

There is an undirected weighted graph with $n$ vertices labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$.

You are given the integer $n$ and an array $edges$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$ with a weight of $w_i$.

A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.

The cost of a walk starting at node $u$ and ending at node $v$ is defined as the bitwise AND of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk.

You are also given a 2D array $query$, where $query[i] = [s_i, t_i]$. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex $s_i$ and ending at vertex $t_i$. If there exists no such walk, the answer is $-1$.

Return the array $answer$, where $answer[i]$ denotes the minimum cost of a walk for query $i$.
