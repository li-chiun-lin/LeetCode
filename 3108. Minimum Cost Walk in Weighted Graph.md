# Hard

There is an undirected weighted graph with $n$ vertices labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$.

You are given the integer $n$ and an array $edges$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$ with a weight of $w_i$.

A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.

The cost of a walk starting at node $u$ and ending at node $v$ is defined as the bitwise AND of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk.

You are also given a 2D array $query$, where $query[i] = [s_i, t_i]$. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex $s_i$ and ending at vertex $t_i$. If there exists no such walk, the answer is $-1$.

Return the array $answer$, where $answer[i]$ denotes the minimum cost of a walk for query $i$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minimumCost(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<vector<int>>& query) {
        vector<int> value(n, 131071);
        vector<int> g(n);
        iota(begin(g), end(g), 0);

        function<int(int)> find = [&](int x)
        {
            return g[x] == x ? x : g[x] = find(g[x]);
        };

        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);

        for (auto& e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back({e[1], e[2]});
            adj[e[1]].push_back({e[0], e[2]});
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            queue<int> que;
            que.push(i);

            while (size(que))
            {
                int u = que.front();
                que.pop();
                int gu = find(u);

                for (auto [v, w] : adj[u])
                {
                    int gv = find(v);
                    value[gu] = value[gv] = value[gu] & value[gu] & w;

                    if (gu != gv)
                    {
                        g[gu] = gv;
                        que.push(v);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        vector<int> ans;

        for (auto& q : query)
        {
            int gx = find(q[0]);
            int gy = find(q[1]);

            ans.push_back(q[0] == q[1] ? 0 :
                            gx == gy ? value[gx] : -1);
        }

        return ans;
