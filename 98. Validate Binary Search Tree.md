Given the $root$ of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool rec(TreeNode *root, long left, long right)
    {
        if (! root)
            return true;
        
        return left < root->val &&
                root->val < right &&
                rec(root->left, left, root->val) && 
                rec(root->right, root->val, right);
    }
    
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return rec(root, (long)INT_MIN - 1, (long)INT_MAX + 1);
    }
};
```
