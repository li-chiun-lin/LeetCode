# Easy

There is a robot starting at the position $(0, 0)$, the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at $(0, 0)$ after it completes its moves.

You are given a string moves that represents the move sequence of the robot where $moves[i]$ represents its $i$-th move. Valid moves are **'R'** (right), **'L'** (left), **'U'** (up), and **'D'** (down).

Return $true$ if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        
        for (char m : moves)
        {
            if (m == 'U')
                -- y;
            else if (m == 'D')
                ++ y;
            else if (m == 'L')
                -- x;
            else if (m == 'R')
                ++ x;
        }
        
        return x == 0 && y == 0;
    }
};
```
