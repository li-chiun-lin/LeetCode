# Easy

Given two strings $first$ and $second$, consider occurrences in some text of the form **"first second third"**, where $second$ comes immediately after $first$, and $third$ comes immediately after $second$.

Return an array of all the words $third$ for each occurrence of **"first second third"**.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findOcurrences(string text, string first, string second) {
        vector<string> ret;
        vector<string> ts;
        stringstream ss(text);
        string tok;
        
        while (ss >> tok)
            ts.push_back(tok);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < ts.size() - 2; ++i)
            if (ts[i] == first && ts[i + 1] == second)
                ret.push_back(ts[i + 2]);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
