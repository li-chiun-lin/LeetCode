# Hard

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'.

You are also given a 2D integer array $queries$ of length $q$, where each $queries[i]$ is one of the following:

- $[1, j]$: Flip the character at index $j$ of $s$ i.e. 'A' changes to 'B' (and vice versa). This operation mutates $s$ and affects subsequent queries.
- $[2, l, r]$: Compute the minimum number of character deletions required to make the substring $s[l..r]$ alternating. This operation does not modify $s$; the length of $s$ remains $n$.

A substring is alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. A substring of length 1 is always alternating.

Return an integer array $answer$, where $answer[i]$ is the result of the ith query of type $[2, l, r]$.
