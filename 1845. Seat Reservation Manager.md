Design a system that manages the reservation state of **n** seats that are numbered **from 1 to n**.

Implement the **SeatManager** class:

- **SeatManager(int n)** Initializes a **SeatManager** object that will manage **n** seats numbered **from 1 to n**. All seats are initially available.
- **int reserve()** Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
- **void unreserve(int seatNumber)** Unreserves the seat with the given seatNumber.

```cpp
class SeatManager {
    priority_queue<
        int, 
        vector<int>, 
        greater<int>
        > pq;
public:
    SeatManager(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            pq.push(i);
    }
    
    int reserve() {
        int t = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        return t;
    }
    
    void unreserve(int seatNumber) {
        pq.push(seatNumber);
    }
};
```
