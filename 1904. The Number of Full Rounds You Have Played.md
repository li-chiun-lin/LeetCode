You are participating in an online chess tournament. There is a chess round that starts every 15 minutes. The first round of the day starts at **00:00**, and after every **15** minutes, a new round starts.

You are given two strings **loginTime** and **logoutTime** where:

- **loginTime** is the time you will login to the game, and
- **logoutTime** is the time you will logout from the game.

If **logoutTime** is earlier than **loginTime**, this means you have played from **loginTime** to midnight and from midnight to **logoutTime**.

Return the number of full chess rounds you have played in the tournament.

Note: All the given times follow the 24-hour clock. That means the first round of the day starts at **00:00** and the last round of the day starts at **23:45**.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int tomin(string &str)
    {
        int h = (str[0] - '0') * 10 + str[1] - '0';
        int m = (str[3] - '0') * 10 + str[4] - '0';
        
        return h * 60 + m;
    }
public:
    int numberOfRounds(string loginTime, string logoutTime) {
        int it = tomin(loginTime);
        int ot = tomin(logoutTime);

        int iq = ceil((float)it / 15);
        int oq = floor((float)ot / 15);
        
        if (logoutTime < loginTime)
            return 96 - iq + oq;
        else
            return max(0, oq - iq);
    }
};
```
