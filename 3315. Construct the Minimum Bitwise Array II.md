You are given an array $nums$ consisting of $n$ prime integers.

You need to construct an array $ans$ of length $n$, such that, for each index $i$, the bitwise OR of $ans[i]$ and $ans[i] + 1$ is equal to $nums[i]$.

Additionally, you must minimize each value of $ans[i]$ in the resulting array.

If it is not possible to find such a value for $ans[i]$ that satisfies the condition, then set $ans[i] = -1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int cnt(int x)
    {
        int c = 0;

        while (x & 1)
        {
            ++ c;
            x >>= 1;
        }

        return c;
    }

public:
    vector<int> minBitwiseArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ans;

        for (auto p : nums)
        {
            ans.push_back(p == 2
                ? -1
                : p - (1 << (cnt(p) - 1)));
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
