# Medium

You are given an array $nums$ consisting of non-negative integers.

We define the score of subarray $nums[l..r]$ such that $l <= r$ as $nums[l]$ AND $nums[l + 1]$ AND ... AND $nums[r]$ where AND is the bitwise AND operation.

Consider splitting the array into one or more subarrays such that the following conditions are satisfied:

- Each element of the array belongs to exactly one subarray.
- The sum of scores of the subarrays is the minimum possible.

Return the maximum number of subarrays in a split that satisfies the conditions above.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int min_score = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i)
            min_score &= nums[i];
        
        if (min_score != 0)
            return 1;
        
        int cnt = 0;
        int val = -1;
        
        for (int x : nums)
        {
            val &= x;
            
            if (val == min_score)
            {
                ++ cnt;
                val = -1;
            }
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
