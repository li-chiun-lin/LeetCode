# Easy

You are given a 2D integer array $tasks$ where $tasks[i] = [s_i, t_i]$.

Each $[s_i, t_i]$ in $tasks$ represents a task with start time $s_i$ that takes $t_i$ units of time to finish.

Return the earliest time at which at least one task is finished.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int earliestTime(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
        int ans = INT_MAX;

        for (auto& t : tasks)
            ans = min(ans, t[0] + t[1]);

        return ans;
    }
};
```
