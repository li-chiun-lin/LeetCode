# Hard

You are given an array $nums$ consisting of positive integers and an integer $k$.

Partition the array into two ordered groups such that each element is in exactly one group. A partition is called great if the sum of elements of each group is greater than or equal to $k$.

Return the number of distinct great partitions. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPartitions(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int m = 1e9 + 7;
        long long sum = 0;
        long long ans = 1;
        vector<long long> dp(k);

        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int x : nums)
        {
            for (int i = k - 1 - x; i >= 0; --i)
                dp[i + x] = (dp[i + x] + dp[i]) % m;

            ans = ans * 2 % m;
            sum += x;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
            ans -= sum - i < k ? dp[i] : dp[i] * 2;

        return (ans % m + m) % m;
    }
};
