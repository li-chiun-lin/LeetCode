A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

Given a shuffled sentence **s** containing no more than **9** words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.

```cpp
bool cmp(string &a, string &b)
{
    int i = a.back() - '0';
    int j = b.back() - '0';
    
    return i < j;
}

class Solution {
public:
    string sortSentence(string s) {
        vector<string> ws;
        stringstream ss(s);
        string t = "";
        string ret = "";
        
        while (ss >> t)
            ws.push_back(t);
        
        sort(ws.begin(), ws.end(), cmp);
        
        for (string &s : ws)
        {
            s.pop_back();
            ret += s + " ";
        }
        
        ret.pop_back();
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
