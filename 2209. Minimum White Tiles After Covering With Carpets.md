# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed binary string $floor$, which represents the colors of tiles on a floor:

- $floor[i] =$ '0' denotes that the $i$-th tile of the floor is colored black.
- On the other hand, $floor[i] =$ '1' denotes that the $i$-th tile of the floor is colored white.

You are also given $numCarpets$ and $carpetLen$. You have $numCarpets$ black carpets, each of length $carpetLen$ tiles. Cover the tiles with the given carpets such that the number of white tiles still visible is minimum. Carpets may overlap one another.

Return the minimum number of white tiles still visible.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumWhiteTiles(string floor, int numCarpets, int carpetLen) {
        int n = size(floor);
        vector<int> suffix(n + 1);
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(numCarpets + 1, -1));

        function<int(int, int)> dfs = [&](int i, int c)
        {
            if (i >= n)
                return 0;

            if (c == numCarpets)
                return suffix[i];

            if (dp[i][c] != -1)
                return dp[i][c];

            return dp[i][c] = min(
                    dfs(i + carpetLen, c + 1), 
                    dfs(i + 1, c) + floor[i] - '0');
        };

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
            suffix[i] = suffix[i + 1] + floor[i] - '0';

        return dfs(0, 0);
    }
};
```
