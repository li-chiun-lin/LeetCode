You are given two integers $numBottles$ and $numExchange$.

$numBottles$ represents the number of full water bottles that you initially have. In one operation, you can perform one of the following operations:

- Drink any number of full water bottles turning them into empty bottles.
- Exchange $numExchange$ empty bottles with one full water bottle. Then, increase $numExchange$ by one.

Return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxBottlesDrunk(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int ans = 0;

        while (numBottles >= numExchange)
        {
            ans += numExchange;
            numBottles += -numExchange + 1;
            numExchange += 1;
        }

        return ans + numBottles;
    }
};
```
