Given a string **word**, return the sum of the number of vowels **('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u')** in every substring of **word**.

A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

Note: Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit integer. Please be careful during the calculations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long countVowels(string word) {
        long long r = 0;
        int n = word.size();
        
        for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (word[i] == 'a' 
             || word[i] == 'e' 
             || word[i] == 'i' 
             || word[i] == 'o' 
             || word[i] == 'u')
                r += (i + 1) * (n - i);
        
        return r;
    }
};
```
