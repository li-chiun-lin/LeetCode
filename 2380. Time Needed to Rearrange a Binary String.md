You are given a binary string $s$. In one second, all occurrences of "01" are simultaneously replaced with "10". This process repeats until no occurrences of "01" exist.

Return the number of seconds needed to complete this process.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int secondsToRemoveOccurrences(string s) {
        int z = 0;
        int c = 0;

        for (char i : s)
        {
            z += '1' - i;

            if (i == '1' && z)
                c = max(c + 1, z);
        }

        return c;
    }
};
```
