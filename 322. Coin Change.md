You are given an integer array **coins** representing coins of different denominations and an integer **amount** representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return **-1**.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        int n = coins.size();
        vector<vector<long>> dp(n + 1, vector<long>(amount + 1, INT_MAX));
        
        // if the target amount is zero, 
        // then the total count of coin shall be zero, too.
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
            dp[i][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = 1; j <= amount; ++j)
            {
                // if the remaining amount of money is larger than 
                // the denomination of the current coin
                // take one coin of denomination i,
                // so the total coin count wiil be added by 1,
                // and the total remaining money will be minused by coins[i - 1].
                if (coins[i - 1] <= j)
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - coins[i - 1]] + 1);
                // don't take coin of denomination i, 
                // so the total coin count remains the same as i - 1, 
                // and the total remaining money remains the same as j;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][amount] == INT_MAX ? -1 : dp[n][amount];
    }
};
