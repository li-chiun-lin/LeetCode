# Easy

You are given a 2D array $events$ which represents a sequence of events where a child pushes a series of buttons on a keyboard.

Each $events[i] = [index_i, time_i]$ indicates that the button at index $index_i$ was pressed at time $time_i$.

- The array is sorted in increasing order of $time$.
- The time taken to press a button is the difference in time between consecutive button presses. The time for the first button is simply the time at which it was pressed.

Return the $index$ of the button that took the longest time to push. If multiple buttons have the same longest time, return the button with the smallest $index$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int buttonWithLongestTime(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        pair<int, int> longestPress = {-1, INT_MAX};
        int previousTime = 0;

        for (const auto& event : events)
        {
            int duration = event[1] - previousTime;

            if (duration > longestPress.first || (duration == longestPress.first && event[0] < longestPress.second))
                longestPress = {duration, event[0]};

            previousTime = event[1];
        }

        return longestPress.second;
    }
};
```
