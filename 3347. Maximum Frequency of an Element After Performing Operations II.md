# Hard

You are given an integer array $nums$ and two integers $k$ and $numOperations$.

You must perform an operation $numOperations$ times on $nums$, where in each operation you:

- Select an index $i$ that was not selected in any previous operations.
- Add an integer in the range $[-k, k]$ to $nums[i]$.

Return the maximum possible frequency of any element in $nums$ after performing the operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k, int numOperations) {
        // Maps to record event points and frequency counts for sweep line
        map<int, int> eventDelta;
        map<int, int> numFrequency;
        set<int> eventPoints;

        // Populate frequency counts and mark event points for the sweep line
        for (int num : nums) {
            ++numFrequency[num];
            ++eventDelta[num - k];      // Start range of influence at num - k
            --eventDelta[num + k + 1];  // End range of influence at num + k + 1

            // Collect unique event points for sweeping
            eventPoints.insert(num);
            eventPoints.insert(num - k);
            eventPoints.insert(num + k + 1);
        }

        int maxFrequency = 1;
        int activeEvents = 0;

        // Sweep through event points in sorted order to compute max frequency
        for (int point : eventPoints) {
            activeEvents += eventDelta[point]; // Update active events at current point
            
            // Calculate achievable frequency at this point
            int achievableFrequency = numFrequency[point] + min(activeEvents - numFrequency[point], numOperations);
            maxFrequency = max(maxFrequency, achievableFrequency);
        }

        return maxFrequency;
    }
};
```
