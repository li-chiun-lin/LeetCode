There is a supermarket that is frequented by many customers. The products sold at the supermarket are represented as two parallel integer arrays $products$ and $prices$, where the $i$-th product has an ID of $products[i]$ and a price of $prices[i]$.

When a customer is paying, their bill is represented as two parallel integer arrays $product$ and $amount$, where the $j$-th product they purchased has an ID of $product[j]$, and $amount[j]$ is how much of the product they bought. Their subtotal is calculated as the sum of each $amount[j] \times$ (price of the $j$-th product).

The supermarket decided to have a sale. Every $n$-th customer paying for their groceries will be given a percentage discount. The discount amount is given by $discount$, where they will be given $discount$ percent off their subtotal. More formally, if their subtotal is $bill$, then they would actually pay $bill \times ((100 - discount) / 100)$.

Implement the __Cashier__ class:

- __Cashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices)__ Initializes the object with $n$, the $discount$, and the $products$ and their $prices$.
- __double getBill(int[] product, int[] amount)__ Returns the final total of the bill with the discount applied (if any). Answers within $10^{-5}$ of the actual value will be accepted.

```cpp
class Cashier {
    int n;
    int c;
    int d;
    map<int, int> p;
    
public:
    Cashier(int n, int discount, vector<int>& products, vector<int>& prices) {
        this->n = n;
        this->c = 0;
        this->d = discount;

        for (int i = 0; i < size(products); ++i)
            p[products[i]] = prices[i];
    }
    
    double getBill(vector<int> product, vector<int> amount) {
        double sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < size(product); ++i)
            sum += p[product[i]] * amount[i];

        if (++ c == n)
        {
            c = 0;
            sum *= (100 - d) / 100.0;
        }

        return sum;
    }
};
```
