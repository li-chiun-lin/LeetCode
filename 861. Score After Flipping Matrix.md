# Medium

You are given an $m \times n$ binary matrix $grid$.

A move consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column.

Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible score after making any number of moves (including zero moves).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int matrixScore(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int r_mask = (1 << n) - 1;
        
        vector<int> vec(m);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        {
            if (grid[i][0])
                continue;
            
            // toggling row to set leading bits in i-th row
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                grid[i][j] = 1 - grid[i][j];
        }
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
        {
            int cnt = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
                cnt += grid[i][j];
            
            if (cnt * 2 >= m)
                continue;
            
            // toggling col to make more 1's than 0's in j-th column
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
                grid[i][j] = 1 - grid[i][j];
        }
        
        // sum the values
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        {
            int v = 0;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                v = (v << 1) + grid[i][j];
            
            sum += v;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
