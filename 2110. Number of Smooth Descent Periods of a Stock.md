# Medium

You are given an integer array **prices** representing the daily price history of a stock, where **prices[i]** is the stock price on the **i**-th day.

A smooth descent period of a stock consists of one or more contiguous days such that the price on each day is lower than the price on the preceding day by exactly **1**. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return the number of smooth descent periods.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long fac(int x)
    {
        if (x <= 1)
            return x;
        
        return x + fac(x - 1);
    }

    long long getDescentPeriods(vector<int>& prices) {
        int cnt = 0;
        long long ret = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i)
        {
            if (prices[i - 1] - 1 == prices[i])
                ++ cnt;
            else
            {
                if (cnt)
                    ret += fac(cnt);
                cnt = 0;
            }
        }
        
        if (cnt)
            ret += fac(cnt);
        
        return ret + prices.size();
    }
};
```
