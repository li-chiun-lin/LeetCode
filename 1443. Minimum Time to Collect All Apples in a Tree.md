Given an undirected tree consisting of $n$ vertices numbered from $0$ to $n-1$, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array $edges$, where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ means that exists an edge connecting the vertices $a_i$ and $b_i$. Additionally, there is a boolean array $hasApple$, where $hasApple[i] = true$ means that vertex $i$ has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTime(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<bool>& hasApple) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        vector<int> deg(n);
        vector<int> cnt(n);
        
        // a small trick to avoid the root been considered as an intermediate node.
        deg[0] = 1;
        
        for (auto &e : edges)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
            ++ deg[e[0]];
            ++ deg[e[1]];
        }
        
        queue<int> que;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (deg[i] == 1)
                que.push(i);
        
        while (que.size())
        {
            int u = que.front();
            que.pop();
            
            for (int v : adj[u])
            {
                if (hasApple[u])
                {
                    hasApple[v] = true;
                    cnt[v] += cnt[u] + 1;
                }
                
                if (-- deg[v] == 1)
                    que.push(v);
            }
        }
        
        return cnt[0] * 2;
    }
};
```
