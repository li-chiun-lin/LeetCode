# Hard

You are given a 0-indexed positive integer array $nums$ and a positive integer $k$.

A pair of numbers $(num1, num2)$ is called excellent if the following conditions are satisfied:

- Both the numbers $num1$ and $num2$ exist in the array $nums$.
- The sum of the number of set bits in $num1$ **OR** $num2$ and $num1$ **AND** $num2$ is greater than or equal to $k$, where **OR** is the bitwise **OR** operation and **AND** is the bitwise **AND** operation.

Return the number of distinct excellent pairs.

Two pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ are considered distinct if either $a \ne c$ or $b \ne d$.

Note that a pair $(num1, num2)$ such that $num1 == num2$ can also be excellent if you have at least one occurrence of $num1$ in the array.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long countExcellentPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        map<int, long long> cnt;
        long long ret = 0;
        
        for (int x : set<int>(begin(nums), end(nums)))
            ++ cnt[__builtin_popcount(x)];
        
        int limit = cnt.rbegin()->first;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= limit; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= limit; ++j)
                if (i + j >= k)
                    ret += cnt[i] * cnt[j];
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
