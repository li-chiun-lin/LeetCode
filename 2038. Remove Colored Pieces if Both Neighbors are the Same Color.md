# Medium

There are **n** pieces arranged in a line, and each piece is colored either by **'A'** or by **'B'**. You are given a string colors of length **n** where **colors[i]** is the color of the **i**-th piece.

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take alternating turns removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice moves first.

- Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored **'A'** if both its neighbors are also colored **'A'**. She is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored **'B'**.
- Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored **'B'** if both its neighbors are also colored **'B'**. He is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored **'A'**.
- Alice and Bob cannot remove pieces from the edge of the line.
- If a player cannot make a move on their turn, that player loses and the other player wins.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return **true** if Alice wins, or return **false** if Bob wins.

class Solution {
public:
    bool winnerOfGame(string colors) {
        int len[2] = {0};
        int cnt[2] = {0};
        char cur = colors[0];
        int idx = cur - 'A';
        
        len[idx] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < colors.size(); ++i)
        {
            if (cur == colors[i])
                ++ len[idx];
            else
            {
                if (len[idx] > 2)
                    cnt[idx] += len[idx] - 2;
                
                cur = colors[i];
                idx = cur - 'A';
                len[idx] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        if (len[idx] > 2)
            cnt[idx] += len[idx] - 2;
        
        return cnt[0] > cnt[1];
    }
};
