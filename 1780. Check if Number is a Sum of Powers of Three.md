Given an integer **n**, return **true** if it is possible to represent **n** as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return **false**.

An integer **y** is a power of three if there exists an integer **x** such that $y == 3^x$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        
        while (n)
        {
            // if n % 3 == 0
            //      it is okay because it means n DO NOT have this 3^x term.
            // if n % 3 == 1
            //      it is also okay because n DO have this 3^x term.
            // if n % 3 == 2
            //      it is NOT GOOD bacause n have two terms of 3^x, which is false according to the description.
            if (n % 3 == 2)
                return false;
            
            n /= 3;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
