The chess knight has a unique movement, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an L).

We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight can only stand on a numeric cell.

Given an integer $n$, return how many distinct phone numbers of length $n$ we can dial.

You are allowed to place the knight on any numeric cell initially and then you should perform $n - 1$ jumps to dial a number of length $n$. All jumps should be valid knight jumps.

As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int knightDialer(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj = {
            /* 0 */ {4, 6},
            /* 1 */ {6, 8},
            /* 2 */ {7, 9},
            /* 3 */ {4, 8},
            /* 4 */ {3, 9, 0},
            /* 5 */ {},
            /* 6 */ {0, 1, 7},
            /* 7 */ {2, 6},
            /* 8 */ {1, 3},
            /* 9 */ {4, 2}
        };
        
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(10));
        
        // first digit
        for (int j = 0; j <= 9; ++j)
            dp[0][j] = 1;
        
        // the rest 
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            for (int u = 0; u <= 9; ++u)
                for (int v : adj[u])
                    dp[i][u] = (dp[i][u] + dp[i - 1][v]) % mod;
        
        return accumulate(begin(dp[n - 1]), end(dp[n - 1]), 0LL) % mod;
    }
};
```
