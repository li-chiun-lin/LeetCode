You are given an integer $delay$, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person every day, starting from $delay$ days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer $forget$, which means that each person will forget the secret $forget$ days after discovering it. A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.

Given an integer $n$, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day $n$. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int peopleAwareOfSecret(int n, int delay, int forget) {
        vector<long long> dp(n + 1);
        dp[1] = 1;
        int share = 0;
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i)
            dp[i] = share = (share + dp[max(i - delay, 0)] - dp[max(i - forget, 0)] + mod) % mod;

        for (int i = n - forget + 1; i <= n; ++i)
            ans = (ans + dp[i]) % mod;

        return ans;
    }
};
