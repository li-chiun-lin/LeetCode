The XOR sum of a list is the bitwise XOR of all its elements. If the list only contains one element, then its XOR sum will be equal to this element.

You are given two 0-indexed arrays $arr1$ and $arr2$ that consist only of non-negative integers.

Consider the list containing the result of $arr1[i]$ AND $arr2[j]$ (bitwise AND) for every $(i, j)$ pair where $0 \leq i < arr1.length$ and $0 \leq j < arr2.length$.

Return the XOR sum of the aforementioned list.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getXORSum(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2) {
        int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;

        for (auto x : arr1)
            v1 ^= x;

        for (auto x : arr2)
            v2 ^= x;

        return v1 & v2;
    }
};
```
