# Hard

You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Remove any pair of adjacent characters in the string that are consecutive in the alphabet, in either order.
- Shift the remaining characters to the left to fill the gap.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after performing the operations optimally.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to check if two characters are consecutive in circular alphabet
    bool isConsec(char a, char b) {
        return abs(a - b) == 1 || abs(a - b) == 25;
    }

    // Main function to compute lexicographically smallest string
    string lexicographicallySmallestString(string s) {
        int n = s.size();

        // dp[i][j] = smallest string we can get from s[i..j-1]
        vector<vector<string>> dp(n + 1, vector<string>(n + 1, ""));

        // Iterate over all possible lengths of substrings
        for (int len = 1; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; i++) {
                int j = i + len;

                // Default choice: keep s[i] and solve the rest
                string res = s[i] + dp[i + 1][j];

                // Try removing s[i] and some s[k] (i < k < j) if they are consecutive
                // Also ensure substring between them was removable (i+1 to k should be empty)
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                    if (isConsec(s[i], s[k]) && dp[i + 1][k] == "") {
                        // If s[i] and s[k] are removable, try resulting string after s[k]
                        res = min(res, dp[k + 1][j]);
                    }
                }

                dp[i][j] = res;  // Store best result for s[i..j-1]
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n];  // Result for full string
    }
};
```
