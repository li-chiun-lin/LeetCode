# Easy

You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on $s$ until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string s) {
        string ret(s.length(), 0);
        int i = -1;
        int j = 0;
        
        while (j < s.length())
        {
            if (i == -1 || ret[i] != s[j])
                ret[++ i] = s[j];
            else 
                -- i;

            ++ j;
        }
        
        return ret.substr(0, i + 1);
    }
};
```
