You are given an integer $n$ and a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with n nodes labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$. This is represented by a 2D array $edges$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]$ indicates a directed edge from node $u_i$ to $v_i$ with weight $w_i$.

You are also given two integers, $k$ and $t$.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible sum of edge weights for any path in the graph such that:

- The path contains exactly $k$ edges.
- The total sum of edge weights in the path is strictly less than $t$.

Return the maximum possible sum of weights for such a path. If no such path exists, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Depth-First Search with memoization to find maximum weight of a path of length k starting from node `u`
    int dfs(vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& adj, int u, int currentWeight, int remainingEdges, int maxWeightLimit,
            vector<vector<map<int, int>>>& memo) {
        
        // If weight exceeds or equals the threshold, path is invalid
        if (currentWeight >= maxWeightLimit)
            return -1;

        // If no more edges are to be used, return current weight
        if (remainingEdges == 0)
            return currentWeight;

        // Memoization check
        if (memo[u][remainingEdges].count(currentWeight))
            return memo[u][remainingEdges][currentWeight];

        int maxPathWeight = -1;

        // Explore all neighbors
        for (const auto& [v, w] : adj[u]) {
            int result = dfs(adj, v, currentWeight + w, remainingEdges - 1, maxWeightLimit, memo);
            maxPathWeight = max(maxPathWeight, result);
        }

        // Memoize and return result
        return memo[u][remainingEdges][currentWeight] = maxPathWeight;
    }

public:
    // Find the maximum weight of any path with exactly k edges and total weight < t
    int maxWeight(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int k, int t) {
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);  // Adjacency list: node -> list of (neighbor, weight)

        // Build the adjacency list from edge list
        for (const auto& e : edges) {
            int u = e[0], v = e[1], w = e[2];
            adj[u].emplace_back(v, w);
        }

        // 3D memoization table: node × remainingEdges × currentWeight
        vector<vector<map<int, int>>> memo(n, vector<map<int, int>>(k + 1));

        int globalMaxWeight = -1;

        // Try starting DFS from every node
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int result = dfs(adj, i, 0, k, t, memo);
            globalMaxWeight = max(globalMaxWeight, result);
        }

        return globalMaxWeight;
    }
};
