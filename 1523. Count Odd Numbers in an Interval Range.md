# Easy

Given two non-negative integers $low$ and $high$. Return the count of odd numbers between $low$ and $high$ (inclusive).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        if (low % 2 == 0 && high % 2 == 0)
            return (high - low) / 2;
        
        return (high - low) / 2 + 1;
    }
};
```
