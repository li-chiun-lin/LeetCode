# Medium

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ and an integer array $cost$ of the same length, where $cost[i]$ is the cost to delete the $i$-th character of $s$.

You may delete any number of characters from $s$ (possibly none), such that the resulting string is non-empty and consists of equal characters.

Return an integer denoting the minimum total deletion cost required.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minCost(string s, vector<int>& cost) {
        long long sum = 0;
        int n = size(s);
        vector<long long> c(26);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            sum += cost[i];
            c[s[i] - 'a'] += cost[i];
        }

        return sum - *max_element(begin(c), end(c));
    }
};
```
