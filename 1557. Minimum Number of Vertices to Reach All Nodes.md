Given a directed acyclic graph, with $n$ vertices numbered from $0$ to $n-1$, and an array $edges$ where $edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]$ represents a directed edge from node $from_i$ to node $to_i$.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int find(int x, vector<int> &ds)
    {
        if (x == ds[x])
            return x;
        
        return find(ds[x], ds);
    }
    
    vector<int> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<int> ret;
        vector<int> ds(n);
        
        // init disjoint sets.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ds[i] = i;
        
        // join sets.
        for (auto &e : edges)
            ds[e[1]] = e[0];
        
        set<int> ss;
        
        // we only need to keep one element for each disjoint set.
        for (int i = 0;i < n; ++i)
            ss.insert(find(i, ds));
        
        return vector<int>(ss.begin(), ss.end());
    }
};
```
