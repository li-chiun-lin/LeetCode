# Hard

There is an undirected tree with $n$ nodes labeled from $1$ to $n$. You are given the integer $n$ and a 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$ in the tree.

Return the number of valid paths in the tree.

A path $(a, b)$ is valid if there exists exactly one prime number among the node labels in the path from $a$ to $b$.

Note that:

- The path $(a, b)$ is a sequence of distinct nodes starting with node $a$ and ending with node $b$ such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.
- Path $(a, b)$ and path $(b, a)$ are considered the same and counted only once.

        for (long long i = 2; i <= n; ++i)

            long long root_a = ! sieve[u];
