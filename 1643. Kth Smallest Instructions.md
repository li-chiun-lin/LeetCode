# Hard

Bob is standing at cell $(0, 0)$, and he wants to reach $destination$: $(row, column)$. He can only travel right and down. You are going to help Bob by providing instructions for him to reach destination.

The instructions are represented as a string, where each character is either:

- 'H', meaning move horizontally (go right), or
- 'V', meaning move vertically (go down).

Multiple instructions will lead Bob to destination.

However, Bob is very picky. Bob has a lucky number $k$, and he wants the $k$-th lexicographically smallest instructions that will lead him to destination. $k$ is 1-indexed.

Given an integer array $destination$ and an integer $k$, return the $k$-th lexicographically smallest instructions that will take Bob to $destination$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int cmb(int n, int r)
    {
        long long ans = 1;

        for (int i = 1, j = n - r + 1; i <= r; ++i, ++j)
            ans = ans * j / i;

        return ans;
    }

public:
    string kthSmallestPath(vector<int>& destination, int k) {
        int h = destination[1];
        int v = destination[0];
        int n = h + v;
        string ans = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            if (h)
            {
                int c = cmb(h - 1 + v, v);

                if (k <= c)
                {
                    ans.push_back('H');
                    -- h;
                }
                else
                {
                    k -= c;
                    ans.push_back('V');
                    -- v;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                ans.push_back('V');
                -- v;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
