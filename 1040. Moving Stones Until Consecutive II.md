# Medium

There are some stones in different positions on the X-axis. You are given an integer array $stones$, the positions of the stones.

Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position. In one move, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves (i.e., the stones are in three consecutive positions).

Return an integer array $answer$ of length $2$ where:

- $answer[0]$ is the minimum number of moves you can play, and
- $answer[1]$ is the maximum number of moves you can play.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numMovesStonesII(vector<int>& stones) {
        int n = size(stones);

        sort(begin(stones), end(stones));

        int ma = max(stones[n - 1] - stones[1], stones[n - 2] - stones[0]) - n + 2;
        int mi = n;

        for (int left = 0, right = 0; right < n; ++ right)
        {
            while (stones[right] - stones[left] >= n)
                ++ left;

            if (right - left + 1 == n - 1 && stones[right] - stones[left] + 1 == n - 1)
                mi = min(mi, 2);
            else
                mi = min(mi, n - (right - left + 1));
        }

        return {mi, ma};
    }
};
```
