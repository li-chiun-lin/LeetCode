# Easy

You are given three integers $x$, $y$, and $z$, representing the positions of three people on a number line:

- $x$ is the position of Person 1.
- $y$ is the position of Person 2.
- $z$ is the position of Person 3, who does not move.

Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed.

Determine which person reaches Person 3 first:

- Return 1 if Person 1 arrives first.
- Return 2 if Person 2 arrives first.
- Return 0 if both arrive at the same time.

Return the result accordingly.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Returns:
    // 1 if x is closer to z,
    // 2 if y is closer to z,
    // 0 if both are equally close to z
    int findClosest(int x, int y, int z) {
        int distanceToX = abs(x - z);
        int distanceToY = abs(y - z);

        if (distanceToX < distanceToY) {
            return 1; // x is closer to z
        } else if (distanceToY < distanceToX) {
            return 2; // y is closer to z
        } else {
            return 0; // Both are equally close
        }
    }
};
```
