Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string.

You are given a string $s$, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts first:

- On Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from $s$ that contains an odd number of vowels.
- On Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from $s$ that contains an even number of vowels.

The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return $true$ if Alice wins the game, and $false$ otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool is_vowel(char c)
    {
        return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';
    }
    
public:
    bool doesAliceWin(string s) {
        int cnt = 0;
        
        for (char c : s)
            if (is_vowel(c))
                return true;

        return false;
    }
};
```
