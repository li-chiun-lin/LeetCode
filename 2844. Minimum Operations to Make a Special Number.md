# Medium

You are given a 0-indexed string $num$ representing a non-negative integer.

In one operation, you can pick any digit of $num$ and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of $num$, $num$ becomes $0$.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make $num$ special.

An integer $x$ is considered special if it is divisible by $25$.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int cnt(string& num, char c1, char c2, char c3)
    {
        int n = num.size();

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
            if (num[i] == c1)
                for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; --j)
                    if (num[j] == c2 || num[j] == c3)
                        return n - j - 2;

        return n;
    }

public:
    int minimumOperations(string num) {
        int n = num.size();
        int r1 = count(begin(num), end(num), '0') ? n - 1 : n;
        int r2 = cnt(num, '0', '0', '5');
        int r3 = cnt(num, '5', '2', '7');

        return min(r1, min(r2, r3));
    }
};
```
