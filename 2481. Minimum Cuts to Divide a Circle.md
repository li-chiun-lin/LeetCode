# Easy

A valid cut in a circle can be:

- A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or
- A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.

Given the integer $n$, return the minimum number of cuts needed to divide a circle into $n$ equal slices.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        
        int cnt = 0;
        
        while (n && n % 2 == 0)
        {
            ++ cnt;
            n -= 2;
        }
        
        return cnt + n;
    }
};
```
