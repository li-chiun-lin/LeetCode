# Hard

You are given a 2D integer array $lists$, where each $lists[i]$ is a non-empty array of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.

You may repeatedly choose two lists $a = lists[i]$ and $b = lists[j]$, where $i \neq j$, and merge them. The cost to merge $a$ and $b$ is:

$len(a) + len(b) + abs(median(a) - median(b))$, where $len$ and $median$ denote the list length and median, respectively.

After merging $a$ and $b$, remove both $a$ and $b$ from lists and insert the new merged sorted list in any position. Repeat merges until only one list remains.

Return an integer denoting the minimum total cost required to merge all lists into one single sorted list.

The median of an array is the middle element after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the left middle element.
