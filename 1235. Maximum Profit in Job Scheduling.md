# Hard

We have $n$ jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from $startTime[i]$ to $endTime[i]$, obtaining a profit of $profit[i]$.

You're given the $startTime$, $endTime$ and $profit$ arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time $X$ you will be able to start another job that starts at time $X$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int jobScheduling(vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime, vector<int>& profit) {
        int n = startTime.size();
        vector<vector<int>> job(n, vector<int>(3));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
                job[i] = {endTime[i], startTime[i], profit[i]};
        
        sort(begin(job), end(job));
        
        map<int, int> dp;
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (auto& j : job)
        {
            int cur = prev(dp.upper_bound(j[1]))->second + j[2];
            
            if (cur > rbegin(dp)->second)
                dp[j[0]] = cur;
        }
        
        return rbegin(dp)->second;
    }
};
```
