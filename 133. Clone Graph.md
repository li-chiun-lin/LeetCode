Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

```cpp
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with $val == 1$, the second node with $val == 2$, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with $val = 1$. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* rec(Node* node, map<Node *, Node *> &visited)
    {
        if (! node)
            return NULL;
        
        if (visited[node])
            return visited[node];
        
        Node* n = new Node(node->val, node->neighbors);
        
        visited[node] = n;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < node->neighbors.size(); ++i)
            n->neighbors[i] = rec(node->neighbors[i], visited);
        
        return n;
    }
    
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        map<Node *, Node *> visited;
        
        return rec(node, visited);
    }
};
```
