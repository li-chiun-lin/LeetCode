You are given a string $s$ and a robot that currently holds an empty string $t$. Apply one of the following operations until $s$ and $t$ are both empty:

- Remove the first character of a string $s$ and give it to the robot. The robot will append this character to the string $t$.
- Remove the last character of a string $t$ and give it to the robot. The robot will write this character on paper.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string robotWithString(string s) {
        string p = "";
        string t = "";
        
        map<char, int> hit;
        
        // count the frequency so that we can track if there are any 
        // smaller char ahead while we scan through `s'
        for (char c : s)
            ++ hit[c];
        
        char low = begin(hit)->first;
        
        // scan through `s'
        for (char c : s)
        {
            t.push_back(c);
            -- hit[c];
            
            // update the smallest char ahead.
            while(low <= 'z' && hit[low] == 0)
                ++ low;
            
            // print all the chars that are smaller than `low'
            while (t.size() && t.back() <= low)
            {
                p.push_back(t.back());
                t.pop_back();
            }
        }
        
        return p;
    }
};
```
