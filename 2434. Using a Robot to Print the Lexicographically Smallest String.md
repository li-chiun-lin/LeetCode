You are given a string $s$ and a robot that currently holds an empty string $t$. Apply one of the following operations until $s$ and $t$ are both empty:

- Remove the first character of a string $s$ and give it to the robot. The robot will append this character to the string $t$.
- Remove the last character of a string $t$ and give it to the robot. The robot will write this character on paper.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string robotWithString(string s) {
        string result, buffer;            // 'result' stores the final output, 'buffer' simulates the stack
        vector<int> freq(26);            // Frequency count of each character in the input string

        // Count how many times each character appears in 's'
        for (char c : s)
            ++freq[c - 'a'];

        int min_char = 0;                // Tracks the smallest character that still exists in the remaining part of 's'

        // Process each character in the input string
        for (char c : s) {
            buffer.push_back(c);         // Push the current character into the stack-like buffer
            --freq[c - 'a'];             // Decrease its remaining count

            // Advance 'min_char' to the next character that still exists
            while (min_char < 26 && freq[min_char] == 0)
                ++min_char;

            // Pop from buffer to result as long as top of buffer is <= smallest remaining character
            while (!buffer.empty() && (buffer.back() - 'a') <= min_char) {
                result.push_back(buffer.back());
                buffer.pop_back();
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
