# Easy

Given an array of integers called $nums$, you can perform the following operation while $nums$ contains at least 2 elements:

- Choose the first two elements of $nums$ and delete them.

The score of the operation is the sum of the deleted elements.

Your task is to find the maximum number of operations that can be performed, such that all operations have the same score.

Return the maximum number of operations possible that satisfy the condition mentioned above.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int score = nums[0] + nums[1];
        int i = 2;
        
        while (i + 1 < size(nums) && nums[i] + nums[i + 1] == score)
            i += 2;
        
        return i / 2;
    }
};
```
