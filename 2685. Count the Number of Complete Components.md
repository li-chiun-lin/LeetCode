You are given an integer $n$. There is an undirected graph with $n$ vertices, numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given a 2D integer array $edges$ where $edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices $a_i$ and $b_i$.

Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.

A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.

```cpp

    // Helper function to perform BFS and check if the connected component is complete

    {

        nodeQueue.push(startNode);
        visited[startNode] = -1; // Mark as visited (temporary flag)
        int edgeCount = 0; // Count the number of edges in the component
        
        while (!nodeQueue.empty())
