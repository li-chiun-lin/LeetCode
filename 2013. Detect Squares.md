You are given a stream of points on the X-Y plane. Design an algorithm that:

- Adds new points from the stream into a data structure. Duplicate points are allowed and should be treated as different points.
- Given a query point, counts the number of ways to choose three points from the data structure such that the three points and the query point form an axis-aligned square with positive area.

An axis-aligned square is a square whose edges are all the same length and are either parallel or perpendicular to the x-axis and y-axis.

Implement the __DetectSquares__ class:

- __DetectSquares()__ Initializes the object with an empty data structure.
- __void add(int[] point)__ Adds a new point $point = [x, y]$ to the data structure.
- __int count(int[] point)__ Counts the number of ways to form axis-aligned squares with point $point = [x, y]$ as described above.

```cpp
class DetectSquares {
    map<pair<int, int>, int> cnt;
    vector<pair<int, int>> p;

public:
    DetectSquares() {
        
    }
    
    void add(vector<int> point) {
        pair<int, int> pp = {point[0], point[1]};
        p.push_back(pp);
        ++ cnt[pp];
    }
    
    int count(vector<int> point) {
        int ans = 0;
        int px = point[0];
        int py = point[1];

        for (auto [x, y] : p)
            if (px != x && py != y && abs(px - x) == abs(py - y))
                ans += cnt[{x, py}] * cnt[{px, y}];

        return ans;
    }
};
```
