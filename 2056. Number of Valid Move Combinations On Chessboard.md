# Hard

There is an $8 \times 8$ chessboard containing $n$ pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array $pieces$ of length $n$, where $pieces[i]$ describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the $i$-th piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array $positions$ also of length $n$, where $positions[i] = [r_i, c_i]$ indicates that the $i$-th piece is currently at the 1-based coordinate $(r_i, c_i)$ on the chessboard.

When making a move for a piece, you choose a destination square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.

- A rook can only travel horizontally or vertically from $(r, c)$ to the direction of $(r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), or (r, c-1)$.
- A queen can only travel horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from $(r, c)$ to the direction of $(r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1), (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1)$.
- A bishop can only travel diagonally from $(r, c)$ to the direction of $(r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1)$.

You must make a move for every piece on the board simultaneously. A move combination consists of all the moves performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel one square towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the $0$-th second. A move combination is invalid if, at a given time, two or more pieces occupy the same square.

Return the number of valid move combinations​​​​​.
