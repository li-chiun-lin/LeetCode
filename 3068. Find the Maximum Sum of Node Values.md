# Hard

There exists an undirected tree with $n$ nodes numbered $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$ in the tree. You are also given a positive integer $k$, and a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers $nums$ of length $n$, where $nums[i]$ represents the value of the node numbered $i$.

Bogdan wants the sum of values of tree nodes to be maximum, for which Bogdan can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero) on the tree:

- Choose any edge $[u, v]$ connecting the nodes $u$ and $v$, and update their values as follows:
  - $nums[u] = nums[u] \oplus k$
  - $nums[v] = nums[v] \oplus k$

Return the maximum possible sum of the values Bogdan can achieve by performing the operation any number of times.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumValueSum(vector<int>& nums, int k, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        long long sum = 0;
        long long cnt = 0;
        long long target = INT_MAX;

        for (long long x : nums)
        {
            long long xk = x ^ k;

            if (xk > x)
            {
                sum += xk;
                cnt += 1;
            }
            else
                sum += x;

            target = min(target, abs(x - xk));
        }

        return cnt % 2 ? sum - target : sum;
    }
};
```
