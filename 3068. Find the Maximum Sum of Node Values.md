# Hard

There exists an undirected tree with $n$ nodes numbered $0$ to $n - 1$. You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$ in the tree. You are also given a positive integer $k$, and a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers $nums$ of length $n$, where $nums[i]$ represents the value of the node numbered $i$.

Bogdan wants the sum of values of tree nodes to be maximum, for which Bogdan can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero) on the tree:

- Choose any edge $[u, v]$ connecting the nodes $u$ and $v$, and update their values as follows:
  - $nums[u] = nums[u] \oplus k$
  - $nums[v] = nums[v] \oplus k$

Return the maximum possible sum of the values Bogdan can achieve by performing the operation any number of times.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumValueSum(vector<int>& nums, int k, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        long long totalSum = 0;       // Accumulates the final sum after XOR operations
        long long xorGainCount = 0;   // Counts how many times XOR increases the value
        long long minDifference = INT_MAX; // Tracks the minimum absolute difference between x and (x ^ k)

        for (int num : nums) {
            int xorResult = num ^ k;

            if (xorResult > num) {
                // XOR improves the value, so use the XOR result
                totalSum += xorResult;
                xorGainCount += 1;
            } else {
                // Otherwise, keep the original value
                totalSum += num;
            }

            // Update the minimum difference for later adjustment if needed
            minDifference = min(minDifference, (long long)abs(num - xorResult));
        }

        // If the number of beneficial XORs is even, the sum is already optimal
        // If it's odd, we need to undo one XOR operation (with the smallest cost)
        return (xorGainCount % 2 == 0) ? totalSum : totalSum - minDifference;
    }
};
