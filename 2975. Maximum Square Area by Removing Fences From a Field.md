# Medium

There is a large $(m - 1) \times (n - 1)$ rectangular field with corners at $(1, 1)$ and $(m, n)$ containing some horizontal and vertical fences given in arrays $hFences$ and $vFences$ respectively.

Horizontal fences are from the coordinates $(hFences[i], 1)$ to $(hFences[i], n)$ and vertical fences are from the coordinates $(1, vFences[i])$ to $(m, vFences[i])$.

Return the maximum area of a square field that can be formed by removing some fences (possibly none) or $-1$ if it is impossible to make a square field.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeSquareArea(int m, int n, vector<int>& hFences, vector<int>& vFences) {
        hFences.push_back(1);
        hFences.push_back(m);
        vFences.push_back(1);
        vFences.push_back(n);

        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        int ans = 0;
        unordered_set<int> ss;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size(hFences); ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < size(hFences); ++j)
                ss.insert(abs(hFences[i] - hFences[j]));

        for (int i = 0; i < size(vFences); ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < size(vFences); ++j)
                if (ss.find(abs(vFences[i] - vFences[j])) != ss.end())
                    ans = max(ans, abs(vFences[i] - vFences[j]));

        return ans == 0 ? -1 : ((long long)ans * ans % mod);
    }
};
```
