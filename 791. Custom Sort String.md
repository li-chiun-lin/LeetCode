You are given two strings $order$ and $s$. All the characters of $order$ are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of $s$ so that they match the order that $order$ was sorted. More specifically, if a character $x$ occurs before a character $y$ in $order$, then $x$ should occur before $y$ in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of $s$ that satisfies this property.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string customSortString(string order, string s) {
        int m = order.size();
        int n = s.size();
        map<char, int> idx;
        vector<pair<int, char>> ord(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
           idx[order[i]] = i;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            ord[i] = {idx[s[i]], s[i]};
        
        sort(begin(ord), end(ord));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            s[i] = ord[i].second;
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
