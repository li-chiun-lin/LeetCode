There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it. You are given a 0-indexed string $s$ consisting of characters '\*' and '|' only, where a '\*' represents a plate and a '|' represents a candle.

You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array $queries$ where $queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]$ denotes the substring $s[left_i...right_i]$ (inclusive). For each query, you need to find the number of plates between candles that are in the substring. A plate is considered between candles if there is at least one candle to its left and at least one candle to its right in the substring.

Return an integer array $answer$ where $answer[i]$ is the answer to the $i$-th query.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> platesBetweenCandles(string s, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int n = size(s);
        vector<int> prev(n + 1), next(n + 1, n + 1);
        vector<int> prefix(n + 1);
        vector<int> ans;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + (s[i] == '|');

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            prev[i + 1] = s[i] == '|' ? i : prev[i];

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
            next[i] = s[i] == '|' ? i : next[i + 1];

        for (auto& q : queries)
        {
            int l = next[q[0]];
            int r = prev[q[1] + 1];
            ans.push_back(l < r ? r - l - prefix[r] + prefix[l] : 0);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
