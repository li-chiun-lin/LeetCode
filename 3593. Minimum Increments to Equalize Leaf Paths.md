You are given an integer $n$ and an undirected tree rooted at node $0$ with $n$ nodes numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$. This is represented by a 2D array $edges$ of length $n - 1$, where $edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]$ indicates an edge from node $u_i$ to $v_i$ .

Each node $i$ has an associated cost given by $cost[i]$, representing the cost to traverse that node.

The score of a path is defined as the sum of the costs of all nodes along the path.

Your goal is to make the scores of all root-to-leaf paths equal by increasing the cost of any number of nodes by any non-negative amount.

Return the minimum number of nodes whose cost must be increased to make all root-to-leaf path scores equal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minIncrease(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& cost) {
        // Build adjacency list
        vector<vector<int>> tree(n);
        for (auto& e : edges) {
            tree[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            tree[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        int increasedCount = 0;

        // DFS returns the max path sum from node down to its deepest leaf
        function<long long(int, int)> dfs = [&](int node, int parent) -> long long {
            vector<long long> childScores;

            // Visit children
            for (int child : tree[node]) {
                if (child == parent) continue;

                auto subScore = dfs(child, node);
                childScores.push_back(subScore);
            }

            // If leaf node, return its own cost
            if (childScores.empty()) {
                return cost[node];
            }

            // Find the maximum child path score
            long long maxSubScore = *max_element(childScores.begin(), childScores.end());

            // Increase child paths to match maxSubScore
            for (auto s : childScores) {
                if (s < maxSubScore) {
                    increasedCount++; // We increased cost somewhere in this subpath
                }
            }

            // Return the total score for this nodeâ€™s path
            return maxSubScore + cost[node];
        };

        dfs(0, -1); // Start DFS from root node 0

        return increasedCount;
    }
};
```
