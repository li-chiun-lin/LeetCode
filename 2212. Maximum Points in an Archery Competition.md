Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules:

1. Alice first shoots **numArrows** arrows and then Bob shoots **numArrows** arrows.
1. The points are then calculated as follows:
    1. The target has integer scoring sections ranging from **0** to **11** **inclusive**.
    1. For **each** section of the target with score **k** (in between **0** to **11**), say Alice and Bob have shot **a<sub>k</sub>** and **b<sub>k</sub>** arrows on that section respectively. If **a<sub>k</sub>** >= **b<sub>k</sub>**, then Alice takes **k** points. If **a<sub>k</sub>** < **b<sub>k</sub>**, then Bob takes **k** points.
    1. However, if **a<sub>k</sub>** == **b<sub>k</sub>** == 0, then nobody takes **k** points.

- For example, if Alice and Bob both shot **2** arrows on the section with score **11**, then Alice takes **11** points. On the other hand, if Alice shot **0** arrows on the section with score **11** and Bob shot **2** arrows on that same section, then Bob takes **11** points.

You are given the integer **numArrows** and an integer array **aliceArrows** of size **12**, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from **0** to **11**. Now, Bob wants to **maximize** the total number of points he can obtain.

Return the array **bobArrows** which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on **each** scoring section from **0** to **11**. The sum of the values in **bobArrows** should equal **numArrows**.

If there are multiple ways for Bob to earn the maximum total points, return **any** one of them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rec(int numArrows, vector<int>& aliceArrows, int k, vector<vector<int>> &dp)
    {
        if (k == 12 || numArrows <= 0)
            return 0;
        
        if (dp[numArrows][k] != -1)
            return dp[numArrows][k];
        
        int r = rec(numArrows, aliceArrows, k + 1, dp);
        
        if (numArrows > aliceArrows[k])
            r = max(r, rec(numArrows - aliceArrows[k] - 1, aliceArrows, k + 1, dp) + k);
        
        return dp[numArrows][k] = r;
        
    }
    vector<int> maximumBobPoints(int numArrows, vector<int>& aliceArrows) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(numArrows + 1, vector<int>(12, -1));
        vector<int> ret(12);
        
        for (int k = 0; k < 12; ++k)
        {
            if (rec(numArrows, aliceArrows, k, dp) != rec(numArrows, aliceArrows, k + 1, dp))
            {
                ret[k] = aliceArrows[k] + 1;
                numArrows -= ret[k];
            }
        }
        
        ret[0] += numArrows;
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
