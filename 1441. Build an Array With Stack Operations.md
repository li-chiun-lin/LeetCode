# Easy

You are given an array $target$ and an integer $n$.

In each iteration, you will read a number from $list = [1, 2, 3, ..., n]$.

Build the $target$ array using the following operations:

- **Push**: Reads a new element from the beginning list, and pushes it in the array.
- **Pop**: Deletes the last element of the array.
- If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.

Return a list of the operations needed to build $target$. The test cases are generated so that the answer is unique.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> buildArray(vector<int>& target, int n) {
        vector<string> ret;
        int top = 1;
        int idx = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < target.size(); ++i)
        {
            while (target[i] > top)
            {
                ret.push_back("Push");
                ret.push_back("Pop");
                ++ top;
            }
            
            ret.push_back("Push");
            ++ top;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
