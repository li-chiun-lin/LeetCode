Given an array $arr$ that represents a permutation of numbers from $1$ to $n$.

You have a binary string of size $n$ that initially has all its bits set to zero. At each step $i$ from $1$ to $n$, the bit at position $arr[i]$ is set to $1$.

You are also given an integer $m$. Find the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length $m$. A group of ones is a contiguous substring of $1$'s such that it cannot be extended in either direction.

Return the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length exactly $m$. If no such group exists, return $-1$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLatestStep(vector<int>& arr, int m) {
        int n = size(arr);

        if (n == m)
            return n;

        set<pair<int, int>> ss;
        ss.insert({1, n});
        int step = 0;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0 && size(ss); --i)
        {
            auto it = prev(ss.upper_bound({arr[i], INT_MAX}));
            auto [l, r] = *it;
            ss.erase(it);

            int l1 = arr[i] - l;
            int l2 = r - arr[i];

            if (l1 == m || l2 == m)
                return n - step - 1;

            if (l1 >= 1)
                ss.insert({l, arr[i] - 1});

            if (l2 >= 1)
                ss.insert({arr[i] + 1, r});

            ++ step;
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
