# Easy

You are given two strings $s$ and $t$.

String $t$ is generated by random shuffling string $s$ and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to $t$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int x = 0;
        
        for (char c : s)
            x ^= c;
        
        for (char c : t)
            x ^= c;
        
        return x;
    }
};
```
