# Medium

You are given two string arrays $positive_feedback$ and $negative_feedback$, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that no word is both positive and negative.

Initially every student has $0$ points. Each positive word in a feedback report increases the points of a student by $3$, whereas each negative word decreases the points by $1$.

You are given $n$ feedback reports, represented by a 0-indexed string array $report$Â and a 0-indexed integer array $student_id$, where $student\_id[i]$ represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report $report[i]$. The ID of each student is unique.

Given an integer $k$, return the top $k$ students after ranking them in non-increasing order by their points. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.

```cpp
class cmp
{
public:
    bool operator()(pair<int, int>& a, pair<int, int>& b)
    {
        if (a.first == b.first)
            return a.second < b.second;
        
        return a.first > b.first;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> topStudents(vector<string>& positive_feedback, vector<string>& negative_feedback, vector<string>& report, vector<int>& student_id, int k) {
        int n = report.size();
        set<string> pos(begin(positive_feedback), end(positive_feedback));
        set<string> neg(begin(negative_feedback), end(negative_feedback));
        vector<pair<int, int>> vec(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            vec[i].second = student_id[i];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            stringstream ss(report[i]);
            string tok;
            
            while (ss >> tok)
            {
                if (pos.count(tok))
                    vec[i].first += 3;
                else if (neg.count(tok))
                    vec[i].first -= 1;
            }
        }
 
        sort(begin(vec), end(vec), cmp());
        
        vector<int> ret(k);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
            ret[i] = vec[i].second;
        
        return ret;
    }
};
