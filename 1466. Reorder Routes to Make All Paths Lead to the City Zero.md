# Medium

There are $n$ cities numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$ and $n - 1$ roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by $connections$ where $connections[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ represents a road from city $a_i$ to city $b_i$.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city $0$), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city $0$. Return the minimum number of edges changed.

It's guaranteed that each city can reach city $0$ after reorder.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(int u, vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<vector<int>> &bdj, vector<bool> &va, vector<bool> &vb)
    {
        int c = 0;
        
        va[u] = true;
        
        for (int v : adj[u])
            if (! va[v])
                c += dfs(v, adj, bdj, va, vb) + 1;
        
        vb[u] = true;
        
        for (int v : bdj[u])
            if (! vb[v])
                c += dfs(v, adj, bdj, va, vb);
        
        return c;
    }
    
    int minReorder(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n), bdj(n);
        vector<bool> va(n), vb(n);
        
        for (auto &e : connections)
        {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            bdj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        
        return dfs(0, adj, bdj, va, vb);
    }
};
```
