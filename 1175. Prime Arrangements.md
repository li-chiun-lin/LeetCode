# Easy

Return the number of permutations of $1$ to $n$ so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.)

(Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)

Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numPrimeArrangements(int n) {
        vector<bool> sieve(n + 1, true);
        sieve[0] = false;
        sieve[1] = false;
        int cp = 0;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i)
            if (sieve[i])
            {
                ++ cp;
                for (int j = i + i; j <= n; j += i)
                    sieve[j] = false;
            }
        
        int cn = n - cp;
        long long ret = 1;
        
        while (cp)
        {
            ret = (ret * cp) % 1000000007;
            -- cp;
        }
        
        while (cn)
        {
            ret = (ret * cn) % 1000000007;
            -- cn;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
