# Easy

You are given an integer $n$, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:

- If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of $n / 2$ matches are played, and $n / 2$ teams advance to the next round.
- If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of $(n - 1) / 2$ matches are played, and $(n - 1) / 2 + 1$ teams advance to the next round.

Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int seed = 0;
        
        while (n > 1)
        {
            seed = n % 2;
            n >>= 1;
            cnt += n;
            
            n += seed;
        }
        
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
