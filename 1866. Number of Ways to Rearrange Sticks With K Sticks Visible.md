# Hard

There are $n$ uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from $1$ to $n$. You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly $k$ sticks are visible from the left. A stick is visible from the left if there are no longer sticks to the left of it.

Given $n$ and $k$, return the number of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rearrangeSticks(int n, int k) {
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<long long>> dp(n + 1, vector<long long>(k + 1, -1));

        function<long long(long long, long long)> dfs = [&](long long n, long long k) -> long long
        {
            if (k == 0 || k > n)
                return 0;

            if (n <= 2)
                return 1;

            if (dp[n][k] == -1)
                dp[n][k] = (dfs(n - 1, k - 1) + (n - 1) * dfs(n - 1, k)) % mod;

            return dp[n][k];
        };

        return dfs(n, k);
    }
};
```
