# Hard

You have $n$ computers. You are given the integer $n$ and a 0-indexed integer array $batteries$ where the $i$-th battery can run a computer for $batteries[i]$ minutes. You are interested in running all $n$ computers simultaneously using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert at most one battery into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery any number of times. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return the maximum number of minutes you can run all the $n$ computers simultaneously.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxRunTime(int n, vector<int>& b) {
        long long sum = accumulate(begin(b), end(b), 0L);
        sort(begin(b), end(b));

        // if the currently largest battery is larger than the average, 
        // we can safely assign this battery to one of the n computers,
        // then we reduce this problem to n - 1.
        while (b.back() > sum / n)
        {
            n -= 1;
            sum -= b.back();
            b.pop_back();
        }

        // the rest of the batteries can not go beyound this upper bound.
        return sum / n;
    }
};
```
