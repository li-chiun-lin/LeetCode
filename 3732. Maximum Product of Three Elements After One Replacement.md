# Medium

You are given an integer array $nums$.

You must replace exactly one element in the array with any integer value in the range $[-10^5, 10^5]$ (inclusive).

After performing this single replacement, determine the maximum possible product of any three elements at distinct indices from the modified array.

Return an integer denoting the maximum product achievable.
