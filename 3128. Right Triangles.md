You are given a 2D boolean matrix $grid$.

Return an integer that is the number of right triangles that can be made with the 3 elements of $grid$ such that all of them have a value of 1.

Note:

- A collection of 3 elements of $grid$ is a right triangle if one of its elements is in the same row with another element and in the same column with the third element. The 3 elements do not have to be next to each other.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long numberOfRightTriangles(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        long long ans = 0;
        int m = size(grid);
        int n = size(grid[0]);
        vector<long long> row(m), col(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                if (grid[i][j])
                {
                    ++ row[i];
                    ++ col[j];
                }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                if (grid[i][j])
                    ans += (row[i] - 1) * (col[j] - 1);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
