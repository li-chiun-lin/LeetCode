Given a $m \times n$ $grid$ filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, INT_MAX));
        
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        dp[1][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i - 1][j - 1];
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
