Given an integer array $nums$ and a positive integer $k$, return the most competitive subsequence of $nums$ of size $k$.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence $a$ is more competitive than a subsequence $b$ (of the same length) if in the first position where $a$ and $b$ differ, subsequence $a$ has a number less than the corresponding number in $b$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostCompetitive(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ret;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < n - (k - ret.size()))
        {
            if  (ret.size() && ret.back() > nums[i])
                ret.pop_back();
            else
            {
                if (ret.size() < k)
                    ret.push_back(nums[i]);

                ++ i;
            }
        }
        
        while (i < n)
            ret.push_back(nums[i ++]);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
